1000 MT,,2020,2021,"'Domestic production of salt was estimated to have decreased slightly in 2021 compared with that in 2020 to 40 million tons. The total value of salt sold or used was estimated to be about $2.5 billion. Twenty-six companies operated 63 plants in 16 States. The top producing States were Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Utah. These seven States produced about 95% of the salt in the United States in 2021. The estimated percentage of salt sold or used was, by type, rock salt, 44%; salt in brine, 40%; vacuum pan salt, 10%; and solar salt, 6%. Highway deicing accounted for about 42% of total salt consumed. The chemical industry accounted for about 39% of total salt sales, with salt in brine accounting for 90% of the salt used for chemical feedstock. Chlorine and caustic soda manufacturers were the main consumers within the chemical industry. The remaining markets for salt were distributors, 9%; food processing, 4%; agricultural, 2%; and general industrial and primary water treatment, 1% each. The remaining 2% was other uses combined with exports.'",'None.',"'The global COVID-19 pandemic affected production and consumption of salt throughout the world in 2020 and 2021. The chloroalkali industry was most affected because international trade declined, but the entire salt sector was negatively affected to varying degrees. For much of the 202021 winter, temperatures were near or above average with lower or average precipitation throughout most of the traditional U.S. snowbelt. The number of winter weather events including freezing rain, sleet, and snow is a better predictor of demand for rock salt than total snowfall. Several low snowfall or icing events usually require more salt for highway deicing than a single large snowfall event. Rock salt production and imports in 2021 were expected to be near or slightly less than those in 2020 because demand from many local and State transportation departments decreased. Most local and State governments in regions that experienced a less intense winter season reportedly had remaining stockpiles and therefore less need to replenish supplies of rock salt for the 202122 winter. For the 202122 winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a La Nia weather pattern for the second consecutive year. A strong La Nia historically favors an average to warmer temperature pattern, but a moderate La Nia favors a colder winter. Based on several factors, the forecasts slightly favor higher precipitation than a normal winter for the Midwest, interior Northeast, and Northwest areas of the United States. All these areas were predicted to be warmer than average except for the Northwest, which is expected to receive more precipitation than average. A warmer and drier pattern than average was predicted for the southern areas of the United States. These forecasts would indicate that demand for rock salt could decrease in the Midwest and northeastern United States. Demand for salt brine used in the chloralkali industry was expected to increase in 2022 as demand for caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride increases globally, especially in Asia. Salt exports from Australia and especially India have increased in recent years to meet the increasing demand in China, but tensions between China and both countries could affect trade.'","'* World continental resources of salt are vast, and the salt content in the oceans is nearly unlimited. Domestic resources of rock salt and salt from brine are primarily in Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Texas. Saline lakes and solar evaporation salt facilities are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah. Almost every country in the world has salt deposits or solar evaporation operations of various sizes.'","'No economic substitutes or alternatives for salt exist in most applications. Calcium chloride and calcium magnesium acetate, hydrochloric acid, and potassium chloride can be substituted for salt in deicing, certain chemical processes, and food flavoring, but at a higher cost.'"
