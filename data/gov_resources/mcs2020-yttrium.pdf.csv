MT,"Yttrium is one of the rare-earth elements. Bastnaesite (or bastnsite), a rare-earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined in 2019 as a primary product at the Mountain Pass Mine in California, which was restarted in the first quarter of 2018 after being put on care-and-maintenance status in the fourth quarter of 2015. Monazite, a rare-earth phosphate mineral, also may have been produced as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral concentrates. Yttrium was estimated to represent about 0.12% of the rare- earth elements in the Mountain Pass bastnaesite ore. The leading end uses of yttrium were in ceramics, metallurgy, and phosphors. In ceramic applications, yttrium compounds were used in abrasives, bearings and seals, high-temperature refractories for continuous-casting nozzles, jet-engine coatings, oxygen sensors in automobile engines, and wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant cutting tools. In metallurgical applications, yttrium was used as a grain-refining additive and as a deoxidizer. Yttrium was used in heating-element alloys, high-temperature superconductors, and superalloys. In electronics, yttrium-iron garnets were components in microwave radar to control high-frequency signals. Yttrium was an important component in yttrium- aluminum-garnet laser crystals used in dental and medical surgical procedures, digital communications, distance and temperature sensing, industrial cutting and welding, nonlinear optics, photochemistry, and photoluminescence. Yttrium was used in phosphor compounds for flat-panel displays and various lighting applications.",Insignificant.,"China produced most of the worlds supply of yttrium from its weathered clay ion- adsorption ore deposits in the southern Provincesprimarily Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxiand from a lesser number of deposits in Guangxi and Hunan Provinces. Processing was primarily at facilities in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi Provinces. In 2019, yttrium was produced from similar clay deposits in Burma (Myanmar). Globally, yttrium was mainly consumed in the form of oxide compounds for ceramics and phosphors. Lesser amounts were consumed in electronic devices, lasers, optical glass, and metallurgical applications. The average price for yttrium metal decreased by 5% compared with that of 2018. Yttrium oxide prices remained nearly unchanged since 2016. Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology raised the rare-earth mining and separation quotas to record highs of 132,000 tons and 127,000 tons of rare-earth-oxide equivalent, respectively. The yttrium content of the production quota was not specified. In 2019, Chinas exports of yttrium compounds and metal were estimated to be 3,000 tons of yttrium-oxide equivalent, and the leading export destinations were, in descending order, Japan, the United States, Italy, and the Republic of Korea.","Large resources of yttrium in monazite and xenotime are available worldwide in placer deposits, carbonatites, uranium ores, and weathered clay deposits (ion-adsorption ore). Additional resources of yttrium occur in apatite-magnetite-bearing rocks, deposits of niobium-tantalum minerals, nonplacer monazite-bearing deposits, sedimentary phosphate deposits, and uranium ores.","Substitutes for yttrium are available for some applications but generally are much less effective. In most uses, especially in electronics, lasers, and phosphors, yttrium is generally not subject to direct substitution by other elements. As a stabilizer in zirconia ceramics, yttrium oxide may be substituted with calcium oxide or magnesium oxide, but the substitutes generally impart lower toughness."
