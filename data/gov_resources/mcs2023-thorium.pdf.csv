kg,"The worlds primary source of thorium is the rare-earth and thorium phosphate mineral monazite. In 2022, monazite may have been produced as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral concentrates, but thorium was not separated or recovered by any domestic facility. Essentially, all thorium compounds and alloys consumed by the domestic industry were derived from imports. The number of companies that processed or fabricated various forms of thorium for commercial use was not available. Thoriums use in most products was generally limited because of concerns over its naturally occurring radioactivity. Imports of thorium compounds are sporadic owing to changes in consumption and fluctuations in consumer inventory levels. The estimated value of thorium compounds imported for consumption by the domestic industry in 2022 was $85,000 (based on data through August 2022), compared with $175,200 in 2021.",None.,"Domestic demand for thorium alloys, compounds, and metals was limited. In addition to research purposes, various commercial uses of thorium included catalysts, high-temperature ceramics, magnetrons in microwave ovens, metal-halide lamps, nuclear medicine, optical coatings, tungsten filaments, and welding electrodes.Exports of unspecified thorium compounds were 20,300 kilograms through August 2022. About one-half of the exports had a unit value of less than $50 per kilogram, so it is possible that they were misclassified. Owing to potentially misclassified material and variations in the type and purity of thorium compounds, the unit value of exports can vary widely by month and by exporting customs district. Globally, monazite was produced primarily for its rare-earth-element content, and only a small fraction of the byproduct thorium was recovered and consumed. Thailand was the leading producer of monazite. Thorium consumption worldwide is relatively small compared with that of most other mineral commodities. In international trade, China was the leading importer of monazite; Thailand, Madagascar, Vietnam and Nigeria were Chinas leading import sources, in descending order of quantity. The Eneabba mineral sands project (Australia) was producing monazite concentrates for export and, in April 2022, it completed a feasibility study for construction of a fully integrated rare-earths refinery. Monazite is a featured product at the Moma Mine (Mozambique); monazite resources were greater than 100 times the current mining rate (the mine increased production in the third quarter of 2022). The license application of the Kvanefjeld project (Greenland) is in arbitration. The Steenkampskraal Mine (South Africa) obtained a favorable ruling regarding its current mining rights and obtained substantial investment to progress mining activities. Several companies and countries were active in the pursuit of commercializing a new generation of nuclear reactors that would use thorium as a fuel material. Thorium-based nuclear research and development programs have been or were underway in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.","The worlds leading thorium resources are found in placer, carbonatite, and vein-type deposits. Thorium is found in several minerals, including monazite, thorite, and thorianite. According to the World Nuclear Association,8 worldwide identified thorium resources were an estimated 6.4 million tons of thorium. Thorium resources are found throughout the world, most notably in Australia, Brazil, India, and the United States. India has the largest resources (850,000 tons), followed by Brazil (630,000 tons) and Australia and the United States (600,000 tons each)","Nonradioactive substitutes have been developed for many applications of thorium. Yttrium compounds have replaced thorium compounds in incandescent lamp mantles. A magnesium alloy containing lanthanides, yttrium, and zirconium can substitute for magnesium-thorium alloys in aerospace applications. Cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, and zirconium oxides can substitute for thorium in welding electrodes. Several replacement materials (such as yttrium fluoride and proprietary materials) are in use as optical coatings instead of thorium fluoride."
