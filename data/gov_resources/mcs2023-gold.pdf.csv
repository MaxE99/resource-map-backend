MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'In 2022, domestic gold mine production was estimated to be 170 tons, 9% less than that in 2021, and the value was estimated to be $10 billion. Gold was produced at more than 40 lode mines in 11 States, at several large placer mines in Alaska, and at numerous smaller placer mines (mostly in Alaska and in the Western States). Nevada was the leading gold-producing State, accounting for about 72% of total domestic production. About 6% of domestic gold was recovered as a byproduct of processing domestic base-metal ores, chiefly copper ores. The top 28 operations yielded about 98% of the mined gold produced in the United States. Commercial- grade gold was produced at 15 refineries. A few dozen companies, out of several thousand companies and artisans, dominated the fabrication of gold into commercial products. U.S. jewelry manufacturing was heavily concentrated in the New York, NY, and Providence, RI, areas, with lesser concentrations in California, Florida, and Texas.'","'In 2022, an estimated 90 tons of new and old scrap was recycled, equivalent to about 36% of reported consumption. The domestic supply of gold from recycling decreased slightly compared with that in 2021.'","'The estimated gold price in 2022 was unchanged from the previous record-high annual price in 2021. The Engelhard daily price of gold in 2022 increased in the first quarter, decreased in the second quarter, and fluctuated in the third quarter. Several factors were reported to have caused the increase in the gold price: gold demand for safe-haven buying increased owing to the continued coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and global investor uncertainty. In 2022, worldwide gold mine production was estimated to be unchanged compared with that in 2021. Production decreases in Papua New Guinea and the United States were more than offset by production increases in Colombia, Indonesia, and Burkina Faso. Estimated global gold consumption was in jewelry, 47%; physical bars, 17%; central banks and other institutions, 20%; official coins and medals and imitation coins, 9%; electrical and electronics, 6%; and other, 1%. In the first 9 months of 2022, global consumption of gold in physical bars decreased by 3%, jewelry increased by 5%, electronics decreased by 4%, other industrial applications were essentially unchanged, and coins and medals increased by 15% compared with those in the first 9 months of 2021. Global investments in gold-based exchange-traded funds decreased twofold, while gold holdings in central banks increased by 62% during the same period. Total global consumption in the first 9 months of 2022 increased by 18% compared with that in the first 9 months of 2021.'","""An assessment of U.S. gold resources indicated 33,000 tons of gold in identified (15,000 tons) and undiscovered (18,000 tons) resources.'* Nearly one-quarter of the gold in undiscovered resources was estimated to be contained in porphyry copper deposits. The gold resources in the United States, however, are only a small portion of global gold resources.""","'Base metals clad with gold alloys are widely used to economize on gold in electrical and electronic products and in jewelry; many of these products are continually redesigned to maintain high-utility standards with lower gold content. Generally, palladium, platinum, and silver may substitute for gold.'"
