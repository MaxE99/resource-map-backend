kg,,2018.0,2019.0,2019.0,"'During 2019, ores containing 8,400 kilograms of rhenium were mined at six operations (four in Arizona and one each in Montana and Utah). Rhenium compounds are included in molybdenum concentrates derived from porphyry copper deposits, and rhenium is recovered as a byproduct from roasting such molybdenum concentrates. Rhenium recovery occurred in Arizona, Utah, and Pennsylvania. Rhenium-containing products included ammonium perrhenate (APR), metal powder, and perrhenic acid. The major uses of rhenium were in superalloys used in high-temperature turbine engine components and in petroleum-reforming catalysts, representing an estimated 80% and 15%, respectively, of end uses. Bimetallic platinum-rhenium catalysts were used in petroleum reforming for the production of high-octane hydrocarbons, which are used in the production of lead-free gasoline. Rhenium improves the high-temperature (1,000 C) strength properties of some nickel-base superalloys. Rhenium alloys were used in crucibles, electrical contacts, electromagnets, electron tubes and targets, heating elements, ionization gauges, mass spectrographs, metallic coatings, semiconductors, temperature controls, thermocouples, vacuum tubes, and other applications. The value of rhenium consumed in 2019 was about $65 million as measured by the value of imports of rhenium metal and APR.'","'Nickel-base superalloy scrap and scrapped turbine blades and vanes continued to be recycled hydrometallurgically to produce rhenium metal for use in new superalloy melts. The scrapped parts were also processed to generate engine reverta high-quality, lower cost superalloy meltstockby an increasing number of companies, mainly in the United States, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, and Russia. Rhenium- containing catalysts were also recycled.'","'During 2019, the United States continued to rely on imports for much of its supply of rhenium. Canada, Chile, Germany, and Kazakhstan supplied most of the imported rhenium. Rhenium imports for consumption remained essentially unchanged from those in 2018. Primary rhenium production in the United States increased slightly compared with that in 2018. Germany and the United States continued to be the leading secondary rhenium producers. Secondary rhenium production also took place in Canada, Estonia, France, Japan, Poland, and Russia. According to industry sources, approximately 20 to 25 tons of rhenium was recycled worldwide in 2019. For the eighth year in a row, rhenium metal and catalytic-grade APR prices decreased. In 2019, catalytic-grade APR prices averaged $1,300 per kilogram, an 8% decrease from the annual average price in 2018. Rhenium metal pellet prices averaged $1,300 per kilogram in 2019, a 12% decrease from the annual average price in 2018. Consumption of catalyst-grade APR by the petroleum industry was expected to remain at high levels. Demand for rhenium in the aerospace industry, although more unpredictable, was also expected to remain at high levels. The major aerospace companies, however, were expected to continue testing superalloys that contain one-half the quantity of rhenium used in engine blades as currently designed, as well as testing rhenium-free alloys for other engine components. '","'Most rhenium occurs with molybdenum in porphyry copper deposits. Identified U.S. resources are estimated to be about 5 million kilograms, and the identified resources of the rest of the world are approximately'","'Substitutes for rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts are being evaluated continually. Iridium and tin have achieved commercial success in one such application. Other metals being evaluated for catalytic use include gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, silicon, tungsten, and vanadium. The use of these and other metals in bimetallic catalysts might decrease rheniums share of the existing catalyst market; however, this would likely be offset by rhenium-bearing catalysts being considered for use in several proposed gas-to-liquid projects. Materials that can substitute for rhenium in various end uses are as follows: cobalt and tungsten for coatings on copper x-ray targets, rhodium and rhodium-iridium for high-temperature thermocouples, tungsten and platinum-ruthenium for coatings on electrical contacts, and tungsten and tantalum for electron emitters.'"
