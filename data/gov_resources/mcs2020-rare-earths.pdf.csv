MT,,2018,2019,2019.0,"'Rare earths were mined domestically in 2019. Bastnaesite (or bastnasite), a rare- earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA, which was restarted in the first quarter of 2018 after being put on care-and-maintenance status in the fourth quarter of 2015. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was produced as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral concentrates. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2019 was $170 million, an increase from $160 million in 2018. The estimated distribution of rare earths by end use was as follows: catalysts, 75%; metallurgical applications and alloys, 5%; ceramics and glass, 5%; polishing, 5%; and other, 10%.'","'Limited quantities of rare earths from batteries, permanent magnets, and fluorescent lamps are recycled.'","'Global mine production was estimated to have increased to 210,000 tons of rare-earth- oxide equivalent, an 11% increase compared with that of 2018. In the United States, domestic production of mineral concentrates, all of which were exported, increased to 26,000 tons, a 44% increase compared with that of 2018. China continued to dominate the global supply of rare earths. According to Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the mine and separation production quotas for 2019 were 132,000 tons and 127,000 tons, respectively.'","'Rare earths are relatively abundant in the Earths crust, but minable concentrations are less common than for most other ores. In North America, measured and indicated resources of rare earths were estimated to include 2.7 million tons in the United States and more than 15 million tons in Canada.'",'Substitutes are available for many applications but generally are less effective.'
