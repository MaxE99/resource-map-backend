MT,,2021,2022,"In 2022, seven companies operated 10 zeolite mines in six States and produced an estimated 86,000 tons of natural zeolites. Total production increased slightly compared with production in 2021. Chabazite was mined in Arizona, and clinoptilolite was mined in California, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas. Small quantities of erionite, ferrierite, mordenite, and phillipsite were likely also produced. The three leading companies accounted for approximately 80% of total domestic production. An estimated 79,000 tons of natural zeolites were sold in the United States during 2022, 6% more than the sales in 2021. Domestic uses were, in descending order of estimated quantity, animal feed, odor control, water purification, unspecified end uses (such as ice melt, soil amendment, and synthetic turf), pet litter, fertilizer carrier, wastewater treatment, air filtration and gas absorbent, oil and grease absorbent, fungicide or pesticide carrier, aquaculture, and desiccant. Animal feed, odor control, and water purification applications accounted for about 70% of the domestic sales tonnage.","Zeolites used for desiccation, gas absorbance, wastewater cleanup, and water purification may be reused after reprocessing of the spent zeolites. Information about the quantity of recycled natural zeolites was unavailable.","Production almost tripled from 1992 through 2022 owing to increased sales for animal feed, odor control, and water purification applications. Domestic natural zeolite production has remained steady in recent years. However, sales for natural zeolites have waned over the last few years in pet litter and wastewater cleanup applications as a result of competition from other products such as clays and synthetic zeolites. Reported sales of natural zeolites products for the use of synthetic turf, pool filter media, and traction control have become more common within the past 5 years. The increase in sales in 2022 was the result of the expansion of natural zeolites into other applications.",Recent estimates for domestic and global resources of natural zeolites are not available. Resources of chabazite and clinoptilolite in the United States are sufficient to satisfy foreseeable domestic demand.,"For pet litter, zeolites compete with other mineral-based litters, such as those manufactured using bentonite, diatomite, fullers earth, and sepiolite; organic litters made from shredded corn stalks and paper, straw, and wood shavings; and litters made using silica gel. Diatomite, perlite, pumice, vermiculite, and volcanic tuff compete with natural zeolites as lightweight aggregate. Zeolite desiccants compete against such products as magnesium perchlorate and silica gel. Zeolites compete with bentonite, gypsum, montmorillonite, peat, perlite, silica sand, and vermiculite in various soil amendment applications. Activated carbon, diatomite, or silica sand may substitute for zeolites in water-purification applications. As an oil absorbent, zeolites compete mainly with bentonite, diatomite, fullers earth, sepiolite, and a variety of polymer and natural organic products. In animal feed, zeolites compete with bentonite, diatomite, fullers earth, kaolin, silica, and talc as anticaking and flow-control agents."
