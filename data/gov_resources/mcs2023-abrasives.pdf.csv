MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,"'In 2022, fused aluminum oxide was produced by two companies at three plants in the United States and Canada. Production of crude fused aluminum oxide had an estimated value of $3.0 million. Silicon carbide was produced by two companies at two plants in the United States. Production of crude silicon carbide had an estimated value of about $30 million. Metallic abrasives were produced by 11 companies in eight States. Production of metallic abrasives had an estimated value of about $160 million, and metallic abrasive shipments were valued at $190 million. Bonded and coated abrasive products accounted for most abrasive uses of fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide. Metallic abrasives are used primarily for steel shot and grit and cut wire shot, which are used for sandblasting, peening, and stonecutting applications.'","'Up to 30% of fused aluminum oxide may be recycled, and about 5% of silicon carbide is recycled.'","'In 2022, China was the worlds leading manufacturer of abrasive fused aluminum oxide and abrasive silicon carbide. Imports from China, where production costs were lower, continued to challenge abrasives manufacturers in the United States and Canada. China accounted for 93% of United States imports of crude fused aluminum oxide, 13% of ground and refined fused aluminum oxide imports, 90% of crude silicon carbide imports, and 48% of ground and refined silicon carbide imports. Foreign competition is expected to persist and continue to limit production in North America. The import quantity and value of abrasive fused aluminum oxide (crude and ground and refined) in 2022 were 26% and 44% higher, respectively, than those in 2021. The import quantity and value of abrasive silicon carbide (crude and ground and refined) in 2022 were 9% and 76% higher, respectively, than those in 2021. The United States returned to being a net exporter of metallic abrasives in 2022 as compared with being a net importer in 2020 and 2021. Canada was the leading supplier of metallic abrasive imports. The consumption of abrasives in the United States is influenced by activity in the manufacturing sectors that use them, particularly the aerospace, automotive, furniture, housing, and steel industries. The U.S. abrasive markets also are influenced by technological trends. Imports and exports continued to recover from the negative effects from the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and they have returned to pre-pandemic levels.'","'Although domestic resources of raw materials for fused aluminum oxide production are limited, adequate resources are available in the Western Hemisphere. Domestic resources are more than adequate for silicon carbide production.'","'Natural and manufactured abrasives, such as garnet, emery, metallic abrasives, or staurolite, can be substituted for fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide in various applications.'"
