1000 MT,,2020,2021,"'Ammonia was produced by 16 companies at 35 plants in 16 States in the United States during 2021; 2 additional plants were idle for the entire year. About 60% of total U.S. ammonia production capacity was in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas because of their large reserves of natural gas, the dominant domestic feedstock for ammonia. In 2021, U.S. producers operated at about 84% of rated capacity. The United States was one of the worlds leading producers and consumers of ammonia. Urea, ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, ammonium phosphates, and ammonium sulfate were, in descending order of quantity produced, the major derivatives of ammonia produced in the United States. Approximately 88% of apparent domestic ammonia consumption was for fertilizer use, including anhydrous ammonia for direct application, urea, ammonium nitrates, ammonium phosphates, and other nitrogen compounds. Ammonia also was used to produce explosives, plastics, synthetic fibers and resins, and numerous other chemical compounds.'",'None.',"'The Henry Hub spot natural gas price ranged between $2.36 and $6.23 per million British thermal units for most of the year, with an average of about $4.12 per million British thermal units. Natural gas prices in 2021 were higher than those in 2020a result of below average storage levels of natural gas and strong demand for U.S. liquified natural gas. The U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, projected that Henry Hub natural gas spot prices would average around $4.00 per million British thermal units in 2022. The weekly average gulf coast ammonia price was $245 per short ton at the beginning of 2021 and increased to $603 per short ton in late October. The average ammonia price for 2021 was estimated to be $510 per short ton. In 2021, high natural gas prices resulted in higher ammonia prices. A long period of stable and low natural gas prices in the United States made it economical for companies to upgrade existing ammonia plants and construct new nitrogen facilities. The additional capacity has reduced ammonia imports. Expansion in the ammonia industry took place throughout the past 5 years; however, no additional U.S. ammonia capacity increases have been announced. Global ammonia capacity is expected to increase by a total of 4% during the next 4 years. Capacity additions are expected in Africa, eastern Europe, and south Asia. As part of the capacity increase several decarbonized ammonia projects are being proposed. Demand for ammonia is expected to increase by 1% per year with the largest increases expected in Latin America and south Asia. Large corn plantings maintain the continued demand for nitrogen fertilizers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. corn growers planted 37.4 million hectares of corn in crop-year 2021 (July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021), which was 3% greater than the area planted in crop-year 2020. Corn acreage in crop-year 2022 is expected to increase because of anticipated higher returns for corn compared with those of other crops.'","'The availability of nitrogen from the atmosphere for fixed nitrogen production is unlimited. Mineralized occurrences of sodium and potassium nitrates, such as those found in the Atacama Desert of Chile, contribute minimally to the global nitrogen supply.'",'Nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient that has no substitute. No practical substitutes for nitrogen explosives and blasting agents are known.'
