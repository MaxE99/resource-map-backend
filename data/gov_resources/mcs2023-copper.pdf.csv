1000 MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,2022,"""In 2022, the recoverable copper content of U.S. mine production was an estimated 1.3 million tons, an increase of 6% from that in 2021, and was valued at an estimated $11 billion, 6% less than $11.7 billion in 2021. Arizona was the leading copper-producing State and accounted for approximately 70% of domestic output; copper was also mined in Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. Copper was recovered or processed at 25 mines (17 of which accounted for more than 99% of mine production), 2 primary smelters, 2 electrolytic refineries, and 14 electrowinning facilities. An additional primary smelter and electrolytic refinery have been closed indefinitely since October 2019, and a new secondary smelter was in the process of starting up as of September. Refined copper and scrap were consumed at about 30 brass mills, 14 rod mills, and 500 foundries and miscellaneous manufacturers. Copper and copper alloy products were used in building construction, 46%; electrical and electronic products, 21%; transportation equipment, 16%; consumer and general products, 10%; and industrial machinery and equipment, 7%.'""","'Old (post-consumer) scrap, converted to refined metal, alloys, and other forms, provided an estimated 160,000 tons of copper in 2022, and an estimated 670,000 tons of copper was recovered from new (manufacturing) scrap derived from fabricating operations. Of the total copper recovered from scrap, brass and wire-rod mills accounted for approximately 85%; smelters, refiners, and ingot makers, 10%; and chemical plants, foundries, and miscellaneous manufacturers, 5%. Copper recovered from scrap contributed 32% of the U.S. copper supply.'","'In 2022, the largest increase in mined copper output in the United States was at the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, where ore grades and recovery rates were higher than those in 2021 following the transition to mining a new area of the open pit. Copper production also rose significantly at the Morenci and Safford Mines in Arizona, reflecting increased mining, milling, and (or) leaching rates. Owing to labor shortages and lower copper ore grades, the most significant decrease in mined copper output was at the Mission Mine in Arizona. The rampups of the Gunnison Mine in Arizona and the Pumpkin Hollow Mine in Nevada continued to be delayed by technical issues. Refined copper production in the United States increased by an estimated 3% in 2022 compared with that in 2021 because of a greater supply of copper concentrates to the Miami smelter in Arizona, which was partially offset by unplanned stoppages and labor shortages at the Garfield smelter in Utah. A new smelter in North Carolina designed to produce copper anodes from scrap was in the process of ramping up as of September, and at least five other domestic facilities that would recover copper from scrap were expected to begin operating within the next few years. In August, a leading copper wire-rod plant in Amarillo, TX, was indefinitely shut down owing to high production costs, maintenance issues, and labor shortages. The annual average COMEX copper price was projected to be about $4 per pound in 2022, 6% less than that in 2021. Analysts attributed the decreased price primarily to widespread global expectations for reduced economic growth and lower demand for copper in the near future, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation measures in China, and increased strength of the United States dollar relative to other currencies. '","'* A U.S. Geological Survey study of global copper deposits indicated that, as of 2015, identified resources contained 2.1 billion tons of copper, and undiscovered resources contained an estimated 3.5 billion tons.'","'Aluminum substitutes for copper in automobile radiators, cooling and refrigeration tube, electrical equipment, and power cable. Titanium and steel are used in heat exchangers. Optical fiber substitutes for copper in telecommunications applications, and plastics substitute for copper in drain pipe, plumbing fixtures, and water pipe.'"
