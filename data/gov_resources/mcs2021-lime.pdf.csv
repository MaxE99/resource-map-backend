1000 MT,,2019,2020,"'In 2020, an estimated 16 million tons of quicklime and hydrate was produced (excluding independent commercial hydrators?), valued at about $2.2 billion. At yearend, 28 companies were producing lime, which included 18 companies with commercial sales and 10 companies that produced lime strictly for internal use (for example, sugar companies). These companies had 74 primary lime plants (plants operating quicklime kilns) in 28 States and Puerto Rico. One lime plant was idle in 2020. Five of the 28 companies operated only hydrating plants in 9 States. In 2020, the five leading U.S. lime companies produced quicklime or hydrate in 22 States and accounted for about 72% of U.S. lime production. Principal producing States were, in alphabetical order, Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Texas. Major markets for lime were, in descending order of consumption, steelmaking, chemical and industrial applications (such as the manufacture of fertilizer, glass, paper and pulp, and precipitated calcium carbonate, and in sugar refining), flue gas treatment, construction, water treatment, and nonferrous mining.'",'Large quantities of lime are regenerated by paper mills. Some municipal water-treatment plants regenerate lime from softening sludge. Quicklime is regenerated from waste hydrated lime in the carbide industry. Data for these sources were not included as production in order to avoid duplication.',"'In 2020, domestic lime production was estimated to have decreased by 5% from that of 2019. A decline in lime production was a result of plants temporarily closing as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. In San Bernardino County, CA, plans were underway to a construct a new quicklime plant using crushed limestone transported to the site from a nearby quarry. In Texas, one company planned to expand lime production capacity at two separate plants by 2021. One plant was adding a new vertical kiln to meet increasing steel industry demand for high-purity dolomitic lime products. The other plant was adding a new energy-efficient lime kiln to produce high-calcium lime products to meet the increasing demand from the steel and construction industries. The total number of operating quicklime plants was 73 in 2020 along with 10 hydrating plants. Hydrated lime is a dry calcium hydroxide powder made from reacting quicklime with a controlled amount of water in a hydrator. It is used in chemical and industrial, construction, and environmental applications.'",' Domestic and world resources of limestone and dolomite suitable for lime manufacture are very large.',"'Limestone is a substitute for lime in many applications, such as agriculture, fluxing, and sulfur removal. Limestone, which contains less reactive material, is slower to react and may have other disadvantages compared with lime, depending on the application; however, limestone is considerably less expensive than lime. Calcined gypsum is an alternative material in industrial plasters and mortars. Cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, and lime kiln dust are potential substitutes for some construction uses of lime. Magnesium hydroxide is a substitute for lime in pH control, and magnesium oxide is a substitute for dolomitic lime as a flux in steelmaking.'"
