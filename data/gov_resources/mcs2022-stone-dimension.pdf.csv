1000 MT,,2020.0,2021.0,"Approximately 2.3 million tons of dimension stone, valued at $430 million, was sold or used by U.S. producers in 2021. Dimension stone was produced by approximately 200 companies operating 236 quarries in 34 States. Leading producing States were, in descending order by tonnage, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, Georgia, and Vermont. These five States accounted for about 67% of the production quantity and contributed about 56% of the value of domestic production. Approximately 47%, by tonnage, of dimension stone sold or used was limestone, followed by sandstone (20%), granite (18%), dolomite and slate (4% each), and the remaining 7% was divided, in descending order of tonnage, among quartzite, miscellaneous stone, marble, and traprock. By value, the leading sales or uses were for limestone (43%), followed by granite (28%), sandstone (11%), slate (7%), dolomite (4%), and the remaining 7% was divided, in descending order of total value, among marble, quartzite, traprock and miscellaneous stone. Rough stone represented 59% of the tonnage and 54% of the value of all the dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, including exports. The leading uses and distribution of rough stone, by tonnage, were in building and construction (52%) and in irregular-shaped stone (34%). The leading uses and distribution of dressed stone, by tonnage, were in ashlars and partially squared pieces (45%), flagging (11%), slabs and blocks for building and construction (10%), and curbing (9%).","Small amounts of dimension stone were recycled, principally by restorers of old stone work.","The United States remained one of the worlds leading markets for dimension stone. In 2021, total imports of dimension stone increased in value by about 33% compared with the value in 2020. In 2021, increased demand for dimension stone for construction and refurbishment used in residential markets helped offset decreased demand in commercial markets. Both markets were affected by the measures instituted to mitigate the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic. These measures also affected the home remodeling sector, which increased by 7.6% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with that in 2020, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. Dimension stone exports increased slightly to about $48 million. Apparent consumption, by value, was estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2021a 28% increase compared with that in 2020. In November 2021, a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was signed into law, which included $110 billion for construction and repair of bridges and roads and transportation research and other projects. Additional funding included $17 billion and $25 billion to upgrade and repair ports and airports, respectively. The leading uses of rough blocks of stone are in building and construction. Dressed stone, such as slabs, ashlars, and flagging are often used in airport interiors and exteriors. The dimension stone industry continued to be concerned with safety and health regulations and environmental restrictions in 2021, especially those concerning crystalline silica exposure. In 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration finalized new regulations to further restrict exposure to crystalline silica at quarry sites and other industrial operations that use materials containing it. Final implementation of the new regulations took effect in 2021, affecting various industries that use materials containing silica. Most provisions of the new regulations became enforceable on June 23, 2018, for general industry and maritime operations.",Dimension stone resources of the world are sufficient. Resources can be limited on a local level or occasionally on a regional level by the lack of a particular kind of stone that is suitable for dimension purposes.,"Substitutes for dimension stone include aluminum, brick, ceramic tile, concrete, glass, plastics, resin- agglomerated stone, and steel."
