MT,,2021,2022.0,2022,"'Significant U.S. niobium mine production has not been reported since 1959. Companies in the United States produced niobium-containing materials from imported niobium concentrates, oxides, and ferroniobium. Niobium was consumed mostly in the form of ferroniobium by the steel industry and as niobium alloys and metal by the aerospace industry. Major end-use distribution of domestic niobium consumption was estimated as follows: steels, about 75%, and superalloys, about 25%. The estimated value of niobium consumption was $440 million, as measured by the value of imports.'","'Niobium was recycled when niobium-bearing steels and superalloys were recycled; scrap recovery, specifically for niobium content, was negligible. The amount of niobium recycled is not available, but it may be as much as 20% of apparent consumption.'","'In 2022, U.S. niobium apparent consumption (measured in niobium content) was estimated to be 7,600 tons, a 4% increase from that in 2021. One domestic company developing its Elk Creek project in Nebraska announced the results of its 2022 feasibility study. According to the study, the mining and processing operation is expected to produce 7,350 tons per year of ferroniobium, 102 tons per year of scandium trioxide, and 12,060 tons per year of titanium dioxide over a 38-year mine life. The project would be the only niobium mine and primary niobium-processing facility in the United States, with construction to begin after financing is received as required permits have been obtained. Brazil continued to be the world's leading niobium producer, accounting for approximately 89% of global production, followed by Canada with about 8%. According to international trade statistics under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States code 7202.93 (ferroniobium), Brazil's total exports were 56,700 tons from January through August 2022, 6% less than during the same period in 2021. Most of Brazil's exports were sent to China, followed by the Netherlands and Singapore. In 2022, a leading niobium producer in Brazil announced plans to invest $1.7 billion in its production assets to double its sales volume by 2030. The company completed its most recent facility upgrades in late 2021, increasing its total production capacity of ferroniobium to 150,000 metric tons per year (approximately 98,000 tons per year of niobium content). The completion of those projects would provide a significant increase in production in Brazil over the next decade.'",'World resources of niobium are more than adequate to supply projected needs. Most of the worlds identified resources of niobium occur as pyrochlore in carbonatite (igneous rocks that contain more than 50%-by-volume carbonate minerals) deposits and are outside the United States.',"'The following materials can be substituted for niobium, but a performance loss or higher cost may ensue: ceramic matrix composites, molybdenum, tantalum, and tungsten in high-temperature (superalloy) applications; molybdenum, tantalum, and titanium as alloying elements in stainless and high-strength steels; and molybdenum and vanadium as alloying elements in high-strength low-alloy steels.'"
