kg,,2018,2019,2018,2019,2019.0,"'One company in Montana produced over 15,000 kilograms of platinum-group metals (PGMs) with an estimated value of about $680 million. Small quantities of primary PGMs also were recovered as byproducts of copper-nickel mining in Michigan; however, this material was sold to foreign companies for refining. The leading domestic use for PGMs was in catalytic converters to decrease harmful emissions from automobiles. Platinum-group metals are also used in catalysts for bulk-chemical production and petroleum refining; dental and medical devices; electronic applications, such as in computer hard disks, hybridized integrated circuits, and multilayer ceramic capacitors; glass manufacturing; investment; jewelry; and laboratory equipment.'","'About 116,000 kilograms of palladium and platinum was recovered globally from new and old scrap in 2018, including about 49,000 kilograms recovered from automobile catalytic converters in the United States.'","'Progress continued at a domestic mine expansion project; full production from the project was expected by late 2021. Based on platinum content, imports of PGM waste and scrap decreased by 89% in 2018 compared with imports in 2017 and remained at similarly low levels in 2019; however, imports of PGM waste and scrap based on gross weight only decreased by 12% during the same time period. This indicates that imported PGM waste and scrap has increased in content of PGMs other than platinum. Production of PGMs in South Africa, the worlds leading supplier of mined material, decreased by 4% compared with that of 2018 owing to increased labor costs, increased costs for electricity, an unreliable supply of electricity, and challenges related to deep-level mining. The estimated annual average prices of iridium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium increased by 15%, 41%, 50%, and 8%, respectively, compared with those of 2018. The estimated average annual price of platinum was 3% lower than that of 2018, continuing a 5-year trend of declining prices. The price of palladium remained higher than that of platinum in 2019, with palladium prices exceeding a previous high of $1,036.82 in January 2013 and platinum prices decreasing to their lowest level in a decade.'",'World resources of PGMs are estimated to total more than 100 million kilograms. The largest reserves are in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa.',"'Palladium has been substituted for platinum in most gasoline-engine catalytic converters because of the historically lower price for palladium relative to that of platinum. About 25% of palladium can routinely be substituted for platinum in diesel catalytic converters; the proportion can be as much as 50% in some applications. For some industrial end uses, one PGM can substitute for another, but with losses in efficiency.'"
