1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,"'In 2021, the United States was expected to consume 5% of world chromite ore production in various forms of imported materials, such as chromite ore, chromium chemicals, chromium ferroalloys, chromium metal, and stainless steel. Imported chromite ore was consumed by one chemical company to produce chromium chemicals. Stainless-steel and heat-resisting-steel producers were the leading consumers of ferrochromium. Stainless steels and superalloys require the addition of chromium via ferrochromium or chromium- containing scrap. The value of chromium material consumption was expected to be about $850 million in 2021, as measured by the value of net imports, excluding stainless steel, and was a fourfold increase from $201 million in 2020.'","'In 2021, recycled chromium (contained in reported stainless-steel scrap receipts) accounted for 20% of apparent consumption.'","'Chromium is consumed in the form of ferrochromium to produce stainless steel. South Africa was the leading chromite ore producer. Ore production was estimated to increase in 2021 owing to recovery of the market following the COVID-19 pandemic. China was the leading ferrochromium- and stainless-steel-producing country, and the leading chromium-consuming country. Ferrochromium production is electrical-energy intensive, so stricter environmental standards could affect ferrochromium production in China. From October 2020 to October 2021, the monthly average high-carbon ferrochromium price more than doubled. The price of chromium metal increased by 85% in October 2021 compared with the monthly average price in October 2020.'","'""* World resources are greater than 12 billion tons of shipping-grade chromite, sufficient to meet conceivable demand for centuries. World chromium resources are heavily geographically concentrated (95%) in Kazakhstan and southern Africa; United States chromium resources are mostly in the Stillwater Complex in Montana.'","'Chromium has no substitute in stainless steel, the leading end use, or in superalloys, the major strategic end use. Chromium-containing scrap can substitute for ferrochromium in some metallurgical uses.'"
