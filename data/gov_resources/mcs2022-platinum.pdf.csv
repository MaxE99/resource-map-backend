kg,,2020,2021,2020,2021,2021.0,"'One company in Montana produced approximately 18,000 kilograms of PGMs with an estimated value of about $1.4 billion. Small quantities of primary PGMs also were recovered as byproducts of copper-nickel mining in Michigan; however, this material was sold to foreign companies for refining. The leading domestic use for PGMs was in catalytic converters to decrease harmful emissions from automobiles. PGMs are also used in catalysts for bulk-chemical production and petroleum refining; dental and medical devices; electronic applications, such as in computer hard disks, hybridized integrated circuits, and multilayer ceramic capacitors; glass manufacturing; investment; jewelry; and laboratory equipment.'","'About 115,000 kilograms of palladium and platinum was recovered globally from new and old scrap in 2021, including about 53,000 kilograms recovered from automobile catalytic converters in the United States.'","'Progress continued at a domestic mine expansion project, but full production was delayed to 2024 owing to disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and operational challenges associated with ventilation and ground conditions. Production of PGMs in South Africa, the worlds leading supplier of mined material, increased by 138% compared with that in 2020 owing to increased mining in the UG2 orebody of the Bushveld Complex. The estimated annual average prices of palladium, platinum, and ruthenium increased by 18%, 35%, and 88%, respectively, compared with those in 2020, and the estimated prices for rhodium doubled and iridium more than tripled. In addition, the prices of iridium, rhodium, and ruthenium all reached record highs in 2021. Constrained automobile production owing to semiconductor chip shortages and a decline in diesel passenger vehicle production are expected to result in decreased demand for palladium, platinum, and rhodium used in catalytic converters.'","'""World resources of PGMs are estimated to total more than 100 million kilograms. The largest reserves are in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa.'","'Palladium has been substituted for platinum in most gasoline-engine catalytic converters because of the historically lower price for palladium relative to that of platinum. About 25% of palladium can routinely be substituted for platinum in diesel catalytic converters; the proportion can be as much as 50% in some applications. For some industrial end uses, one PGM can substitute for another, but with losses in efficiency.'"
