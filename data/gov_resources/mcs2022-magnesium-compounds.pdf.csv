1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'Seawater and natural brines accounted for about 64% of U.S. magnesium compound production in 2021. The value of shipments of all types of magnesium compounds was estimated to be $390 million, a 7% increase from the revised value in 2020. Magnesium oxide and other compounds were recovered from seawater by one company in California and another company in Delaware, from well brines by one company in Michigan, and from lake brines by two companies in Utah. Magnesite was mined by one company in Nevada. In the United States, about 78% of magnesium compounds were consumed in the form of caustic-calcined magnesia, magnesium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium sulfates across the following industries and uses, in descending order, environmental, agricultural, chemical, and deicing. The remaining magnesium compounds were consumed for refractories in the form of dead-burned magnesia, fused magnesia, and olivine. Across all industries, the leading magnesium compounds consumed, in descending order, were magnesium oxide (caustic-calcined magnesia, dead burned magnesia, and fused magnesia), magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium chloride. '","'Some magnesia-based refractories are recycled, either for reuse as refractory material or for use as construction aggregate.'","'In 2021, consumption of dead-burned and fused magnesia increased in the United States and globally by an estimated 20% and 8%, respectively, compared with that in 2020, as the demand for steel recovers from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand, and subsequent consumption, for all magnesium compounds has increased following the general trend of the manufacturing industry. An Austria-based magnesia and refractories producer sold two of its magnesia product subsidiaries to a private equity firm. The subsidiaries, located in Ireland and Norway, produced magnesia-based products used in the agricultural, environmental, hydrometallurgical, pulp and paper, and refractory industries. A Turkish steelmaker purchased one of Turkeys largest magnesite producers that was a major regional and international source of magnesite. The magnesite producer holds more than 40% of Turkeys magnesite reserves and operates three plants with an annual capacity of 1.2 million tons. The purchase of the magnesite producer will provide refractory materials vital to its steelmaking process. China remains the leading producer of magnesia and magnesite and was the principal exporter of magnesia to the United States and much of the world. As demand was beginning to recover, supply and shipping constraints were adversely affecting the availability of imported sources of magnesia. In China, power-intensive activities such as mineral processing were adversely affected by power outages resulting from a resurging demand for power, coal shortages, and newly enforced emission standards. The resulting decreased magnesia supply in China affected prices and availability of all grades of magnesia in the world market.'","' Resources from which magnesium compounds can be recovered range from large to virtually unlimited and are globally widespread. Identified world magnesite and brucite resources total 13 billion tons and several million tons, respectively. Resources of dolomite, forsterite, magnesium-bearing evaporite minerals, and magnesia-bearing brines are estimated to constitute a resource of billions of tons. Magnesium hydroxide can be recovered from seawater. Serpentine could be used as a source of magnesia but global resources, including in tailings of asbestos mines, have not been quantified but are thought to be very large.'","'Alumina, chromite, and silica substitute for magnesia in some refractory applications.'"
