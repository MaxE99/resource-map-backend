1000 MT,,2021,2022,"Silicon materials were produced at six facilities in 2022, all east of the Mississippi River. Most ferrosilicon was consumed in the ferrous foundry and steel industries, predominantly in the Eastern United States, and was sourced primarily from domestic quartzite (silica). The main consumers of silicon metal were producers of aluminum alloys and the chemical industry, in particular for the manufacture of silicones. The semiconductor and solar energy industries, which manufacture chips for computers and photovoltaic cells from high- purity silicon, respectively, also consumed silicon metal.",Insignificant.,"Combined domestic ferrosilicon and silicon metal production in 2022, expressed in terms of contained silicon, was unchanged from that in 2021. One producer restarted a silicon metal production facility in early 2022 owing to increased demand for silicon metal in North America. By August 2022, average U.S. spot market prices increased by over 80% for both 75%-grade ferrosilicon and silicon metal compared with the annual averages in 2021. Excluding the United States, ferrosilicon accounted for over 60% of world silicon production on a silicon-content basis in 2022. The leading countries for ferrosilicon production were, in descending order on a silicon-content basis, China, Russia, and Norway. For silicon metal, the leading producers were, in descending order on a silicon-content basis, China, Brazil, and Norway. China accounted for almost 70% of total global estimated production of silicon materials in 2022. Global production of silicon materials, on a silicon-content basis, was estimated to be about 4% less than that in 2021. Global production of steel, the leading use of ferrosilicon, decreased in 2022 compared with production in 2021 owing to supply chain disruptions resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and intermittent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related lockdowns in China. In August, the President signed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science (CHIPS) Act of 2022; the Act supports an increase in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing by providing grants for semiconductor manufacturing, grants for research investments, and tax incentives for chip manufacturing.","World and domestic resources for making silicon metal and alloys are abundant and, in most producing countries, adequate to supply world requirements for many decades. The source of the silicon is silica in various natural forms, such as quartzite.","Aluminum, silicon carbide, and silicomanganese can be substituted for ferrosilicon in some applications. Gallium arsenide and germanium are the principal substitutes for silicon in semiconductor and infrared applications."
