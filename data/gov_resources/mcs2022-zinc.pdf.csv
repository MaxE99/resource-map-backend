1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'The value of zinc mined in 2021, based on zinc contained in concentrate, was about $2.4 billion. Zinc was mined in five States at seven mining operations by five companies. Three smelter facilities, one primary and two secondary, operated by three companies, produced commercial-grade zinc metal. Of the total reported zinc consumed, most was used in galvanizing, followed by brass and bronze, zinc-based alloys, and other uses.'","'In 2021, an estimated 60% of the refined zinc produced in the United States was recovered from secondary materials at both primary and secondary smelters. Secondary materials included galvanizing residues and crude zinc oxide recovered from electric arc furnace dust.'","'Estimated global zinc mine production in 2021 increased from that in 2020, when mine production was constrained in some countries because of Government-mandated lockdowns and a decrease in zinc prices following the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, estimated global refined zinc production in 2021 was forecast to increase slightly to 14.13 million tons and estimated metal consumption to increase by 6% to 14.09 million tons, resulting in a production-to-consumption surplus. On November 9, 2021, a proposed revised U.S. critical minerals list was published in the Federal Register (86 FR 62199). The new list contained 50 individual mineral commodities; proposed changes were the addition of nickel and zinc and the removal of helium, potash, rhenium, strontium, and uranium, which were included in the 2018 critical minerals list. '","'"" Identified zinc resources of the world are about 1.9 billion tons.'","'Aluminum and plastics substitute for galvanized sheet in automobiles; aluminum alloys, cadmium, paint, and plastic coatings replace zinc coatings in other applications. Aluminum- and magnesium-base alloys are major competitors for zinc-base diecasting alloys. Many elements are substitutes for zinc in chemical, electronic, and pigment uses.'"
