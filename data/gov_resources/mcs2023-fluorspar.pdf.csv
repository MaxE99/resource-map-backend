1000 MT,,2021.0,2022.0,2022.0,"'In 2022, minimal fluorspar (calcium fluoride, CaF2) was produced in the United States. One company sold fluorspar from stockpiles produced as a byproduct of its limestone quarrying operation in Cave-In-Rock, IL. A second company, which was developing a mine in Utah, received a $5 million loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture which it expected would be used to fund completion of a metallurgical-grade fluorspar-processing plant, rail spur, and tailings dam. An estimated 40,000 tons of fluorosilicic acid (FSA), equivalent to about 65,000 tons of fluorspar grading 100% CaF2, was recovered from three phosphoric acid plants processing phosphate rock. A company in Aurora, NC, continued construction on a plant to produce hydrofluoric acid (HF) from FSA. The U.S. Department of Energy continued to produce aqueous HF as a byproduct of the conversion of depleted uranium hexafluoride to depleted uranium oxide at plants in Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH; the aqueous HF was sold into the commercial market. U.S. fluorspar consumption was satisfied by imports. Domestically, production of HF in Louisiana and Texas was by far the leading use for acid-grade fluorspar. Hydrofluoric acid is the primary feedstock for the manufacture of virtually all fluorine-bearing chemicals, particularly refrigerants and fluoropolymers, and is also a key ingredient in the processing of aluminum and uranium. Fluorspar was also used in cement production, in enamels, as a flux in steelmaking, in glass manufacture, in iron and steel casting, and in welding rod coatings.'","'Synthetic fluorspar may be produced from neutralization of waste in the enrichment of uranium, petroleum alkylation, and stainless-steel pickling; however, undesirable impurities constrain use. Primary aluminum producers recycle HF and fluorides from smelting operations.'","'World production of fluorspar was estimated to have decreased in 2022. Global fluorspar supply, which is highly concentrated, was constrained by the bankruptcy and subsequent idling of a fluorspar mine in Canada and the declaration of force majeure for supply contracts by the worlds leading exporting mine in Mexico. Although prices from leading exporting countries such as Mexico, South Africa, and Vietnam reportedly increased, overall adverse impacts to supply appear to have been more than offset by decreased consumption in China. Overall, China decreased its fluorspar trade deficit. Chinese exports, including to the United States, increased. Chinese imports also decreased substantially, particularly from Mongolia, which likely contributed to a significant decrease in Mongolias fluorspar production. In September, the United States became the 137th country to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The goal of the amendment is to reduce production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases, commonly used as aerosols, refrigerants, and solvents, by 80% over the next 30 years and which is expected to reduce projected global warming by as much as 0.5 degree Celsius by the end of the century. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 essentially established all of the HFC phasedown provisions and enforcement mechanisms needed to comply with the Kigali Amendment. The U.S. Department of Energy awarded $2.8 billion funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to stimulate domestic development of raw materials used in the production of electric-vehicle batteries. Nearly $280 million in funding was awarded for the construction of a new facility in Louisiana to produce lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) and for the expansion of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) production capacity in Georgia. LiPF6 is the main salt used in lithium-ion battery electrolytes; PVDF is used as a binder and separator coating. Additionally, more than $500 million was allocated to facilities that were likely to consume fluorochemicals in the processing of spherical graphite and the production of separator materials.'","'Large quantities of fluorine are present in phosphate rock. Current U.S. reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 1 billion tons, containing about 72 million tons of 100% fluorspar equivalent assuming an average fluorine content of 3.5% in the phosphate rock. World reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 71 billion tons, containing about 5 billion tons of 100% fluorspar equivalent. '","'FSA has been used as an alternative to fluorspar in the production of aluminum fluoride (AIFs) and HF. Because of differing physical properties, AIFs produced from FSA is not readily substituted for AIFs produced from fluorspar. In 2022, a company in Australia was finalizing the design of a pilot plant to recover fluorine from aluminum smelter bath and then produce AIF3 using either bauxite or aluminum smelting dross. Aluminum smelting dross, borax, calcium chloride, iron oxides, manganese ore, silica sand, and titanium dioxide have been used as substitutes for fluorspar fluxes.'"
