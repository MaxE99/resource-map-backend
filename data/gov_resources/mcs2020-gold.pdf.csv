MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'In 2019, domestic gold mine production was estimated to be about 200 tons, 11% less than that in 2018, and the value was estimated to be about $9.0 billion. Gold was produced in 12 States at more than 40 lode mines, at several large placer mines in Alaska, and numerous smaller placer mines (mostly in Alaska and in the Western States). About 7% of domestic gold was recovered as a byproduct of processing domestic base- metal ores, chiefly copper ores. The top 27 operations yielded more than 99% of the mined gold produced in the United States. Commercial-grade gold was produced at about 15 refineries. A few dozen companies, out of several thousand companies and artisans, dominated the fabrication of gold into commercial products. U.S. jewelry manufacturing was heavily concentrated in the New York, NY, and Providence, RI, areas, with lesser concentrations in California, Florida, and Texas. Estimated domestic uses (excluding gold bullion bar) were jewelry, 50%; electrical and electronics, 37%; official coins, 8%; and other, 5%.'","'In 2019, an estimated 130 tons of new and old scrap was recycled, equivalent to about 87% of reported consumption. The domestic supply of gold from recycling increased by 11% compared with that in 2018.'","'The estimated gold price in 2019 was 10% higher than the price in 2018 but was 16% lower than the record-high annual price in 2012. The Engelhard daily price of gold in 2019 fluctuated through several cycles. Early in the year the gold price was about $1,300 per troy ounce and started increasing at the end of May, reaching a projected annual high of $1,547 per troy ounce in September. During this time, several factors were reported to have spurred the increase in price: demand from central banks and investors increased; the U.S. Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates; and trade negotiations halted between the United States and China. The price started a downward trend in October and November. The11% decrease in domestic mine production in 2019 was attributed to decreases in production from the Bald Mountain, Carlin, and Cortez Mines in Nevada and the Fort Knox and Pogo Mines in Alaska. In 2019, worldwide gold mine production was estimated to be unchanged from that in 2018. Increased mine production in Australia, China, and Indonesia offset decreased gold mine production in Peru, South Africa, the United States, and Zimbabwe. In the first 9 months of 2019, domestic consumption of gold used in the production of coins and bars decreased by more than 19%; however, gold consumption for jewelry increased slightly. Globally, gold consumption by the jewelry industry decreased by 5% and gold used for the production of coins and bars decreased by 22% compared with that in the first 9 months of 2018. Investments in gold-based exchange-traded funds were significantly higher in the United States and globally during the same period. Also, gold holdings in central banks increased during the year. '","'An assessment of U.S. gold resources indicated 33,000 tons of gold in identified (15,000 tons) and undiscovered (18,000 tons) resources. Nearly one-quarter of the gold in undiscovered resources was estimated to be contained in porphyry copper deposits. The gold resources in the United States, however, are only a small portion of global gold resources.'","'Base metals clad with gold alloys are widely used in electrical and electronic products, and in jewelry to economize on gold; many of these products are continually redesigned to maintain high-utility standards with lower gold content. Generally, palladium, platinum, and silver may substitute for gold.'"
