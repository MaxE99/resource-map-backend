1000 MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,2022,"'In 2022, a limited amount of bauxite and bauxitic clay was produced for nonmetallurgical use in Alabama, Arkansas, and Georgia. Production statistics for bauxite were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. In 2022, the reported quantity of bauxite consumed was estimated to be 2.9 million tons, 4% more than that reported in 2021, with an estimated value of about $87 million. About 76% of the bauxite was refined by the Bayer process for alumina or aluminum hydroxide, and the remainder went to products such as abrasives, cement, chemicals, proppants, and refractories, and as a slag adjuster in steel mills. Alumina production was estimated to be 1.2 million tons, slightly more than that in 2021. About 63% of the alumina produced went to primary aluminum smelters, and the remainder went to nonmetallurgical products, such as abrasives, ceramics, chemicals, and refractories. '",'None.',"'In 2022, one domestic alumina refinery produced alumina from imported bauxite. A 1.2-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Gramercy, LA, produced alumina for aluminum smelting and specialty- grade alumina. A 500,000-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Burnside, LA, was temporarily shut down in August 2020 and remains idle. No plans were announced regarding reopening its reopening. The average prices, f.a.s., for U.S. imports for consumption of crude dry bauxite and metallurgical-grade alumina during the first 9 months of 2022 were $30 per ton and $553 per ton, a slight decrease and 25% more than those in the same period of 2021, respectively. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine led to the closure of a 1.7-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Ukraine. High energy costs in Europe caused a 600,000-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Romania to temporarily shutter and a 1.7-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Spain to curtail production by up to 60%. Additionally, several primary aluminum smelters and aluminum product manufacturers throughout Europe announced shutdowns or partial curtailments. In August, a 1.4-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Jamaica resumed operations after a fire in 2021 caused a year-long production stoppage. Operations at a 650,000-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Jamaica were suspended by the National Environment and Planning Agency for polluting a nearby river. A United States-based mining company that mines nonmetallurgical bauxite in Guyana acquired a United States proppant manufacturer with two manufacturing facilities located in Georgia.'","'Bauxite resources are estimated to be between 55 billion and 75 billion tons, distributed in Africa (32%), Oceania (23%), South America and the Caribbean (21%), Asia (18%), and elsewhere (6%). Domestic resources of bauxite are inadequate to meet long-term U.S. demand, but the United States and most other major aluminum-producing countries have essentially inexhaustible subeconomic resources of aluminum in materials other than bauxite.'","'Bauxite is the only raw material used in the production of alumina on a commercial scale in the United States. Although currently not economically competitive with bauxite, vast resources of clay are technically feasible sources of alumina. Other raw materials, such as alunite, anorthosite, coal wastes, and oil shales, offer additional potential alumina sources. Synthetic mullite, produced from kaolin, bauxitic kaolin, kyanite, and sillimanite, substitutes for bauxite-based refractories. Silicon carbide and alumina zirconia can substitute for alumina and bauxite in abrasives but cost more.'"
