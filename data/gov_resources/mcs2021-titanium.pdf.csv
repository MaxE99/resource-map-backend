MT,,2019,2020,2019,2020,"'Titanium sponge metal was produced by two operations in Nevada and Utah. Production data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The facility in Salt Lake City, UT, with an estimated capacity of 500 tons per year, produced titanium that was further refined for use in electronics. Sponge operations in Henderson, NV, with an estimated capacity of 12,600 tons per year, were idled at yearend owing to market conditions. A third operation, in Rowley, UT, with an estimated capacity of 10,900 tons per year, remained on care-and-maintenance status since 2016. Although detailed 2020 consumption data were withheld to avoid disclosing proprietary data, the majority of titanium metal was used in aerospace applications, and the remainder was used in armor, chemical processing, marine hardware, medical implants, power generation, consumer, and other applications. The value of imported sponge was about $206 million, a 24% decrease compared with imports in 2019. In 2020, titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment production, by four companies operating five facilities in four States, was valued at about $3 billion. The estimated end-use distribution of TiO2 pigment consumption was paints (including lacquers and varnishes), 60%; plastics, 20%; paper, 5%; and other, 15%. Other uses of TiO2 included catalysts, ceramics, coated fabrics and textiles, floor coverings, printing ink, and roofing granules. '","'About 45,000 tons of titanium scrap metal was consumed in 202035,000 tons by the titanium industry, 8,000 tons by the steel industry, less than 500 tons by the superalloy industry, and the remainder in other industries.'","'Owing to airline travel concerns and restrictions implemented to limit the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic, domestic consumption of titanium sponge in 2020 decreased significantly compared with that of 2019. U.S. producers of titanium ingot continued to rely heavily on imports of titanium sponge and scrap. Imports of titanium sponge decreased by about 20%, and exports increased moderately. Japan (88%) and Kazakhstan (10%) were the leading import sources for titanium sponge in 2020. U.S. imports of titanium waste and scrap were about 18,000 tons. Germany (19%), Japan (18%), the United Kingdom (14%), and France (11%) were the leading import sources for titanium waste and scrap in 2020. At yearend, plans to idle the 12,600-ton-per-year sponge plant in Henderson, NV, left the 500-ton-per-year Salt Lake City, UT, plant as the only active domestic producer of titanium sponge. The U.S. Department of Commerce led investigations under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that determined titanium sponge imports into the United States threatened to impair national security. In 2020, a working group was formed to explore measures to ensure access to titanium sponge in the United States for use for national defense and in critical industries during an emergency. In China, production of titanium sponge increased significantly in 2020, and projects to increase titanium sponge and titanium pigment capacity were expected in 2021. Domestic production of TiO2 pigment in 2020 was estimated to be about 1 million tons. Although heavily reliant on imports of titanium mineral concentrates, the United States was a net exporter of TiO2 pigments. Following a record high of 743,000 tons in 2011, exports of titanium dioxide have followed a declining trend. Since 2011, an increasing percentage of domestic production has been used domestically in lieu of being exported.'",' Reserves and resources of titanium minerals are discussed in the Titanium Mineral Concentrates chapter.',"'Few materials possess titanium metals strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. In high- strength applications, titanium competes with aluminum, composites, intermetallics, steel, and superalloys. Aluminum, nickel, specialty steels, and zirconium alloys may be substituted for titanium for applications that require corrosion resistance. Ground calcium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate, kaolin, and talc compete with titanium dioxide as a white pigment.'"
