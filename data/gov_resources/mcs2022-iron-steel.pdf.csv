1 M. MT,,2020,2021,2020,2021,"'The U.S. iron and steel industry produced raw steel in 2021 with an estimated value of about $110 billion, a 21% increase from $91 billion in 2020. Pig iron and raw steel was produced by three companies operating integrated steel mills in 11 locations. Raw steel was produced by 50 companies at 101 minimills. Combined production capacity was about 106 million tons. Indiana accounted for an estimated 27% of total raw steel production, followed by Ohio, 11%; Pennsylvania, 5%; Illinois and Texas, 4% each; and Michigan, 3%; with no other State having more than 3% of total domestic raw steel production. Construction accounted for an estimated 47% of total domestic shipments by market classification, followed by transportation (predominantly automotive), 25%; machinery and equipment, 9%; appliances and energy, 5% each; and other applications, 9%.'",'See Iron and Steel Scrap and Iron and Steel Slag.',"'The World Steel Association forecast global finished steel consumption to increase by 4.5% in 2021 and by 2.2% in 2022 owing to rebounding demand from the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Global recovery started in late 2020, as manufacturing ramped up in developed countries, through the second half of 2021, when supply chain disruptions affected delivery and demand. In 2021, U.S. apparent consumption of iron and steel increased by 22% from that in 2020. The automotive sector drove domestic increases in steel consumption and there were increases in demand in the construction sector. The potential for infrastructure stimulus programs could speed economic recovery and increase steel demand; however, the effects would take months to years before they become fully realized. Chinas steel demand decreased in June 2021 owing to a variety of factors including pandemic closures and other effects, weak real estate activity, poor weather conditions, reduced investment infrastructure, and reduced exports. Steel consumption in the European Union continued to increase throughout the year owing to increased exports from Germany and increasing construction activity in Italy. Despite worsening pandemic conditions in Asia, steel demand remained unchanged owing to increases in Japans automotive and machinery sectors and an increase in construction activity in the Republic of Korea. Generally, South America experienced a significant decrease in steel demand owing to pandemic conditions in 2020; however, the increased activity in the construction and automotive sectors led to a recovery in steel consumption to pre-pandemic levels.'",'Not applicable. See Iron Ore and Iron and Steel Scrap for steelmaking raw-material resources.',"'Iron is the least expensive and most widely used metal. In most applications, iron and steel compete either with less expensive nonmetallic materials or with more expensive materials that have a performance advantage. lron and steel compete with lighter materials, such as aluminum and plastics in the automotive industry; aluminum, concrete, and wood in construction; and aluminum, glass, paper, and plastics in containers.'"
