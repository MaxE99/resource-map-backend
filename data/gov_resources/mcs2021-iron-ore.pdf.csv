1000 MT,,2019,2020,2019,2020,2019,2020,"'In 2020, mines in Michigan and Minnesota shipped 98% of the usable iron ore products, which were consumed in the steel industry in the United States with an estimated value of $4.1 billion, a decrease from $4.4 billion in 2019. The remaining 2% of domestic iron ore was produced for nonsteel end uses. Seven open pit iron ore mines (each with associated concentration and pelletizing plants), and three iron metallic plantsone direct-reduced iron (DRI) plant in Louisiana and two hot-briquetted iron (HBI) plants in Indiana and Texasoperated during the year to supply steelmaking raw materials. The United States was estimated to have produced 1.5% and consumed 1.1% of the worlds iron ore output.'",'None.',"'Significant decreases in production, shipments, and trade in 2020 were due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which lowered steel production and consumption globally. Domestic iron ore production was estimated to be 37 million tons in 2020, 21% lower than 46.9 million tons in 2019, owing to the closure of multiple iron ore plants. Total raw steel production was estimated to have decreased to 69 million tons in 2020 from 87.8 million tons in 2019. The share of steel produced by basic oxygen furnaces, the process that uses iron ore, continued to decline from 37.3% in 2015 to an estimated 30% in 2020 owing to increased use of electric arc furnaces because of their energy efficiency, reduced environmental impacts, and the ready supply of scrap. Overall, global prices trended upwards to an average value of $97.96 per ton in the first 8 months of 2020, a 4% increase from the 2019 annual average of $93.85 per ton and a 40% increase from the 2018 annual average of $69.75 per ton. Based on reported prices for iron ore fines (62% iron content) imported into China (cost and freight into Tianjin Port), the highest monthly average price during the first 8 months of 2020 was $121.07 per ton in August compared with the high of $120.24 per ton in July 2019. The lowest monthly average price during the same period in 2020 was $84.73 per ton in April compared with the low of $76.16 per ton in January 2019. The prices trended upwards owing to a reduced supply of higher grade iron ore products, spurred partially by closures of pelletizing plants in Brazil. One company in Brazil cut guidance for pellet sales in 2020 by 25 million to 30 million tons based on first-quarter projections following 302 million tons of iron ore production in 2019, a decrease from 385 million tons produced in 2018, owing to a tailings dam collapse that idled operations at the collocated mine. In August, one company expected to begin production at a hot-briquetted iron plant under construction in Ohio in late 2020, and announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase two iron ore mines, six steelmaking facilities, eight finishing facilities, and three coal and cokemaking operations from another domestic iron and steel production company. In the first half of 2020, five domestic iron ore mines were idled with only four restarting in the second half of the year. One mine continued to remain idle with no plans to restart as of October. Globally, iron ore production in 2020 was expected to decrease slightly from that of 2019. Global finished steel consumption was forecast by the World Steel Association5 to decrease by 2.4% in 2020 and increase by 4.1% in 2021.'",'U.S. resources are estimated to be 110 billion tons of iron ore containing about 27 billion tons of iron. U.S. resources are mainly low-grade taconite-type ores from the Lake Superior district that require beneficiation and agglomeration prior to commercial use. World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron.',"'The only source of primary iron is iron ore, used directly as direct-shipping ore or converted to briquettes, concentrates, DRI, iron nuggets, pellets, or sinter. DRI, iron nuggets, and scrap are extensively used for steelmaking in electric arc furnaces and in iron and steel foundries. Technological advancements have been made, which allow hematite to be recovered from tailings basins and pelletized.'"
