1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'In 2022, three companies mined barite in Nevada. Two mines resumed production after having been idle for years, one since 2016 and one since 2020. Mine production increased, but data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The barite assets (two mines and one grinding plant) of a fourth company in Nevada were acquired by a gold-mining company that bought the properties for water and rail access but did not intend to resume barite production. An estimated 2.1 million tons of barite (from domestic production and imports) was sold by crushers and grinders operating in nine States. A company based in Turkey invested $10 million to construct a new grinding plant in Moundsville, WV. Typically, more than 90% of the barite sold in the United States is used as a weighting agent in fluids used in the drilling of oil and natural gas wells. The majority of Nevada crude barite was ground in Nevada and then sold to companies drilling in the Central and Western United States. Because of the higher cost of rail and truck transportation compared to ocean freight, offshore drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore drilling operations in other regions primarily used imported barite. Barite also is used as a filler, extender, or weighting agent in products such as paints, plastics, and rubber. Some specific applications include use in automobile brake and clutch pads, in automobile paint primer for metal protection and gloss, as a weighting agent in rubber, and in the cement jacket around underwater petroleum pipelines. In the metal-casting industry, barite is part of the mold-release compounds. Because barite significantly blocks X-ray and gamma-ray emissions, it is used as aggregate in high-density concrete for radiation shielding around X-ray units in hospitals, nuclear powerplants, and university nuclear research facilities. Ultrapure barite is used as a contrast medium in X-ray and computed tomography examinations of the gastrointestinal tract. '",'None.',"'Historically, rig counts have been a good barometer of barite consumption. In 2022, the monthly average rig count in all regions except for Europe generally increased throughout the year. Through October, the world annual average rig count excluding the United States was 1,050, an increase of 15% compared with that in 2021. In all regions except for Canada, the average annual rig count remained below averages in 2019, before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Increases in worldwide rig counts contributed to an estimated 17% increase in world barite production. In the United States, the annual average rig count increased by nearly 50% in 2022. This trend was reflected in domestic sales of ground barite, which were estimated to have increased by 26%. In addition to increased rig counts, barite consumption in the United States was likely supported by a decrease in the number of drilled-but-uncompleted (DUC) wells, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration began tracking in 2014. The number of DUC wells reached its highest level in June 2020, but by September 2022 had reached its lowest level since the inception of the count. In April, the leading barite mining company in India completed its barite tender that is held every 3 years. Buyers compete for the companys barite production, which is offered in several gradesA-grade with a minimum specific gravity of 4.2, B-grade with a minimum specific gravity of 4.1, and C-, D-, and W-grades, with no guarantee as to specific gravity, but which typically exceeded 3.9. Prices for A- and B-grades increased by about 30% to 45%, or approximately $25 per metric ton. Three U.S. companies reportedly signed agreements to purchase a total of 1.6 million tons of barite. '","' In the United States, identified resources of barite are estimated to be 150 million tons, and undiscovered resources contribute an additional 150 million tons. The worlds barite resources in all categories are about 2 billion tons, but only about 740 million tons are identified resources.'","'In the oil- and gas-well-drilling industry, alternatives to barite include celestite, ilmenite, iron ore, and synthetic hematite that is manufactured in Germany. However, substitutes have been used in relatively small amounts, and barite remains the preferred choice for drilling applications.'"
