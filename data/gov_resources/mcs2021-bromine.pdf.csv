MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'Bromine was recovered from underground brines by two companies in Arkansas. Bromine is one of the leading mineral commodities, in terms of value, produced in Arkansas. The two bromine companies in the United States account for a large percentage of world production capacity. The leading global applications of bromine are for the production of brominated flame retardants and intermediates and industrial uses. Bromine compounds are also used in a variety of other applications, including drilling fluids and industrial water treatment. U.S. apparent consumption of bromine in 2020 was estimated to be less than that in 2019.'","'Some bromide solutions were recycled to obtain elemental bromine and to prevent the solutions from being disposed of as hazardous waste. For example, hydrogen bromide is emitted as a byproduct in many organic reactions. This byproduct waste can be recycled with virgin bromine brines and used as a source of bromine production. Bromine contained in plastics can be incinerated as solid organic waste, and the bromine can be recovered.'","'The United States maintained its position as one of the leading bromine producers in the world. China, Israel, and Jordan also are major producers of elemental bromine. In 2020, U.S. net imports of bromine and bromine compounds decreased compared with those in 2019. The average import value of bromine and bromine compounds increased by about 4% in 2020 compared with that in 2019. The leading source of imports of bromine and bromide compounds (gross weight) in 2020 was Israel. Together, the leading imported bromine products in terms of both gross weight and bromine content were bromides and bromide oxides of ammonium, calcium, or zinc and bromides of sodium or potassium (about 90%). Reported exports of methyl bromide were revised for 2017 through 2019 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Global consumption of bromine and bromine compounds decreased in 2020. Owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for flame retardants and clear brine fluids, leading applications for bromine and bromine compounds, decreased. This decreased demand was attributed to declining consumer spending in the automotive, electronic, and construction industries (which use brominated flame retardants in their products), as well declining demand for drilling fluids by the oil- and gas-well-drilling industries, which use clear brine fluids in oil- and gas-well drilling. Although the values of U.S.-imported bromine and bromine compounds increased in 2020 compared with those in 2019, domestic selling prices were reported to have decreased slightly. Some bromine facilities in Shandong Province, China, restarted production in the first half of 2020 following completion of rectifications and improvements required to meet new environmental regulations initiated by the Government of China in late 2017. However, production volumes and selling prices remained low.'","'* Bromine is found principally in seawater, evaporitic (salt) lakes, and underground brines associated with petroleum deposits. The Dead Sea, in the Middle East, is estimated to contain 1 billion tons of bromine. Seawater contains about 65 parts per million bromine, or an estimated 100 trillion tons. Bromine is also recovered from seawater as a coproduct during evaporation to produce salt.'","'Chlorine and iodine may be substituted for bromine in a few chemical reactions and for sanitation purposes. There are no comparable substitutes for bromine in various oil- and gas-well completion and packer applications. Because plastics have a low ignition temperature, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, organic chlorine compounds, and phosphorus compounds can be substituted for bromine as fire retardants in some uses.'"
