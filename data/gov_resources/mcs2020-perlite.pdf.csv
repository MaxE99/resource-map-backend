1000 MT,,2018,2019,2019.0,"In 2019, the quantity of domestic processed crude perlite sold and used was estimated to be 480,000 tons with a value of $35 million. Crude ore production was from eight mines operated by six companies in five Western States. New Mexico and Oregon continued to be the leading producing States. Processed crude perlite was expanded at 56 plants in 27 States. Domestic apparent consumption was 670,000 tons. The applications for expanded perlite were building construction products, 58%; fillers, 18%; horticultural aggregate, 16%; filter aid, 4%; and other, 4%. Other applications included specialty insulation and miscellaneous uses",Not available.,"Perlite is a siliceous volcanic glass that expands up to 20 times its original volume when rapidly heated. In horticultural uses, expanded perlite is used to provide moisture retention and aeration without compaction when added to soil. Owing primarily to cost, some commercial greenhouse growers in the United States have recently switched to a wood fiber material over perlite. Perlite, however, remained a preferred soil amendment for segments of greenhouse growers because it does not degrade or compact over lengthy growing times and is inert. Construction applications for expanded perlite are numerous because it is lightweight, fire resistant, and an excellent insulator. Novel and small markets for perlite have increased during the past 10 years; cosmetics, environmental remediation, personal care products, and marijuana growing have become increasing markets for perlite. Exploration continued at a perlite deposit in Nevada that could be developed as a potential supplier of crude perlite ore for industrial and household applications.Domestic perlite mining generally takes place in remote areas, and its environmental impact is not severe. The mineral fines, overburden, and reject ore produced during ore mining and processing are used to reclaim the mined- out areas, and, therefore, little waste remains. Airborne dust is captured by baghouses, and virtually no runoff contributes to water pollution. Based on estimated world production for 2019, the worlds leading producers were, in descending order of production, China, Greece, Turkey, and the United States, with about 47%, 20%, 16%, and 13%, respectively, of world production. Although China was the leading producer, most of its perlite production was thought to be consumed internally. Greece and Turkey remained the leading exporters of perlite.","Perlite occurrences in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon are thought to contain large resources. Significant deposits have been reported in China, Greece, Hungary, and Turkey, and a few other countries. Insufficient information is available to make reliable estimates of resources in many perlite-producing countries.","In construction applications, diatomite, expanded clay and shale, pumice, and slag can be substituted for perlite. For horticultural uses, vermiculite, coco coir, wood pulp, and pumice are alternative soil additives and are sometimes used in conjunction with perlite."
