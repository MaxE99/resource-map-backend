1000 MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'In 2020, the United States was expected to consume 4% of world chromite ore production in various forms of imported materials, such as chromite ore, chromium chemicals, chromium ferroalloys, chromium metal, and stainless steel. Imported chromite ore was consumed by one chemical firm to produce chromium chemicals. Stainless-steel and heat-resisting-steel producers were the leading consumers of ferrochromium. Stainless steels and superalloys require the addition of chromium via ferrochromium or chromium- containing scrap. The value of chromium material consumption was expected to be about $600 million in 2020, as measured by the value of net imports, excluding stainless steel, and was an increase from $304 million in 2019.'","'In 2020, recycled chromium (contained in reported stainless steel scrap receipts) accounted for 25% of apparent consumption.'","'Chromium is consumed in the form of ferrochromium to produce stainless steel. South Africa was the leading chromite ore producer. Increased labor costs, increased costs for electricity, an unreliable supply of electricity, temporary mine closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and challenges related to deep level mining could affect production in South Africa in 2020. China was the leading chromium-consuming country. China was also the leading stainless-steel- and ferrochromium- producing country. South Africa was the second-leading country in ferrochromium production. Ferrochromium production is electrical-energy intensive, so constrained electrical power supply and rising costs for electricity in South Africa, as well as temporary closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could also affect ferrochromium production. From September 2019 to September 2020, the monthly average high-carbon ferrochromium price increased by 12%. Prices of chromium metal decreased by 18% in September 2020 compared with the monthly average price in September 2019 and were below the prior low in February 2007. '","""'World resources are greater than 12 billion tons of shipping-grade chromite, sufficient to meet conceivable demand for centuries. World chromium resources are heavily geographically concentrated (95%) in Kazakhstan and southern Africa; United States chromium resources are mostly in the Stillwater Complex in Montana.""","'Chromium has no substitute in stainless steel, the leading end use, or in superalloys, the major strategic end use. Chromium-containing scrap can substitute for ferrochromium in some metallurgical uses.'"
