MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'Significant U.S. niobium mine production has not been reported since 1959. Companies in the United States produced niobium-containing materials from imported niobium concentrates, oxides, and ferroniobium. Niobium was consumed mostly in the form of ferroniobium by the steel industry and as niobium alloys and metal by the aerospace industry. In 2021, there was an increase in apparent consumption of niobium for high-strength low-alloy steel and superalloy applications. Major end-use distribution of domestic niobium consumption was estimated as follows: steels, about 80%, and superalloys, about 20%. The estimated value of niobium consumption was $340 million, as measured by the value of imports.'","'Niobium was recycled when niobium-bearing steels and superalloys were recycled; scrap recovery, specifically for niobium content, was negligible. The amount of niobium recycled is not available, but it may be as much as 20% of apparent consumption.'","'In 2021, U.S. niobium apparent consumption (measured in niobium content) was estimated to be 7,000 tons, an 11% decrease from that in 2020. One domestic company developing its Elk Creek project in Nebraska announced that it acquired a key land parcel in April, affording ownership of 90% of the projects mineral reserves and resources. The project would be the only niobium mine and primary niobium-processing facility in the United States, with construction to begin after financing was obtained. Brazil continued to be the world's leading niobium producer with approximately 88% of global production, followed by Canada with about 10%. Global niobium production and consumption were thought to have increased in 2021 as steel production in most countries began to recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic. According to international trade statistics under the Harmonized Tariff Code 7202.93 (ferroniobium), Brazils total exports were 69,400 tons from January through September 2021, 31% greater than through the same period in 2020. Most of Brazils exports were sent to China, followed by the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea. A leading niobium producer in Brazil completed its most recent capacity upgrades which increased the original capacity by 50% to 150,000 tons per year of niobium products (approximately 98,000 tons per year of niobium content). Further, two additional producers in Brazil entered the funding stages for new capacity upgrades. The completion of those projects could provide a potential significant increase in production in Brazil over the next decade. '",'World resources of niobium are more than adequate to supply projected needs. Most of the worlds identified resources of niobium occur as pyrochlore in carbonatite (igneous rocks that contain more than 50%-by-volume carbonate minerals) deposits and are outside the United States.',"'The following materials can be substituted for niobium, but a performance loss or higher cost may ensue: ceramic matrix composites, molybdenum, tantalum, and tungsten in high-temperature (superalloy) applications; molybdenum, tantalum, and titanium as alloying elements in stainless and high-strength steels; and molybdenum and vanadium as alloying elements in high-strength low-alloy steels.'"
