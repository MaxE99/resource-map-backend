MT,,2021,2022.0,2022.0,"'Rare earths were mined domestically in 2022. Bastnaesite (or bastnasite), a rare- earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was produced as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral- sand concentrates in the southeastern United States. Mixed rare-earth compounds were also produced in the western United States. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2022 was $200 million, a 25% increase from $160 million in 2021. The estimated leading domestic end use of rare earths was catalysts. A significant amount of rare earths are imported as permanent magnets embedded in finished goods. Other end uses were ceramics and glass, metallurgical applications and alloys, and polishing.'","'Limited quantities of rare earths are recovered from batteries, permanent magnets, and fluorescent lamps.'","'Global mine production was estimated to have increased to 300,000 tons of REO equivalent. Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology raised 2022 quotas for rare-earth mining and separation to 210,000 tons and 202,000 tons of REO equivalent, respectively. The mine production quota was allocated to 190,850 tons of light rare earths and 19,150 tons of ion-adsorption clays.'","'Rare earths are relatively abundant in the Earths crust, but minable concentrations are less common than for most other mineral commodities. In North America, measured and indicated resources of rare earths were estimated to include 3.6 million tons in the United States and more than 14 million tons in Canada.'",'Substitutes are available for many applications but generally are less effective.'
