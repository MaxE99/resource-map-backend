MT,,2019,2020,"'In 2020, six companies in the United States operated nine zeolite mines and produced an estimated 88,000 tons of natural zeolites, essentially unchanged from that of 2019. Chabazite was mined in Arizona, and clinoptilolite was mined in California, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas. Minor quantities of erionite, ferrierite, mordenite, and (or) phillipsite also likely were produced. New Mexico was estimated to be the leading natural zeolite-producing State in 2020. The top three companies accounted for approximately 75% of total domestic production. An estimated 77,000 tons of natural zeolites were sold in the United States during 2020, essentially unchanged compared with sales in 2019. Domestic uses were, in decreasing order by estimated quantity, animal feed, odor control, unclassified end uses (such as ice melt, soil amendment, and synthetic turf), water purification, pet litter, wastewater treatment, fungicide or pesticide carrier, oil and grease absorbent, air filtration and gas absorbent, fertilizer carrier, desiccant, and aquaculture. Animal feed, odor control, and water purification applications likely accounted for about 60% of the domestic sales tonnage.'","'Zeolites used for desiccation, gas absorbance, wastewater cleanup, and water purification may be reused after reprocessing of the spent zeolites. Information about the quantity of recycled natural zeolites was unavailable.'","'Prior to the 1990s, annual output of natural zeolites in the United States was less than 15,000 tons. Production rose more than sixfold from 1990 through 2020 owing predominantly to increases in sales for animal feed applications, although sales for odor control and water purification also increased significantly. In contrast, sales for pet litter declined substantially during this period as a result of competition from other products. Owing to disruptions likely caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, mine production during the first 6 months of 2020 was mixed compared with the same period of 2019. Some mines appeared to have cut production and others may have increased production.'",'Recent estimates for domestic and global resources of natural zeolites are not available. Resources of chabazite and clinoptilolite in the United States are sufficient to satisfy foreseeable domestic demand.',"'For pet litter, zeolites compete with other mineral-based litters, such as those manufactured using bentonite, diatomite, fullers earth, and sepiolite; organic litters made from shredded corn stalks and paper, straw, and wood shavings; and litters made using silica gel. Diatomite, perlite, pumice, vermiculite, and volcanic tuff compete with natural zeolite as lightweight aggregate. Zeolite desiccants compete against such products as magnesium perchlorate and silica gel. Zeolites compete with bentonite, gypsum, montmorillonite, peat, perlite, silica sand, and vermiculite in various soil amendment applications. Activated carbon, diatomite, or silica sand may substitute for zeolites in water-purification applications. As an oil absorbent, zeolites compete mainly with bentonite, diatomite, fullers earth, sepiolite, and a variety of polymer and natural organic products. In animal feed, zeolites compete with bentonite, diatomite, fullers earth, kaolin, silica, and talc as anticaking and flow-control agents.'"
