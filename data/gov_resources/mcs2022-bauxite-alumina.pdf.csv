1000 MT,,2020,2021,2020,2021,2021,"'In 2021, the reported quantity of bauxite consumed was estimated to be 3.6 million tons, 8% more than that reported in 2020, with an estimated value of about $115 million. About 70% of the bauxite was refined by the Bayer process for alumina or aluminum hydroxide, and the remainder went to products such as abrasives, cement, chemicals, proppants, and refractories, and as a slag adjuster in steel mills. Alumina production was estimated to be 1 million tons, 25% less than that in 2020. One domestic alumina refinery with production capacity of 1.2 million tons per year accounted for all the production in 2021. Another alumina refinery with 500,000 tons per year of capacity was on care-and-maintenance status the entire year. About 55% of the alumina produced went to primary aluminum smelters, and the remainder went to nonmetallurgical products, such as abrasives, ceramics, chemicals, and refractories. '",'None.',"'In 2021, one domestic alumina refinery produced alumina from imported bauxite. A 1.2-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Gramercy, LA, produced alumina for aluminum smelting and specialty-grade alumina. The Gramercy alumina refinery stopped production for about 1 week at the end of August as a precaution when Hurricane Ida approached the region, but restarted production soon afterwards. A 500,000-ton-per- year alumina refinery in Burnside, LA, was temporarily shut down in August 2020, and no plans have been announced regarding reopening. The average prices, f.a.s., for U.S. imports for consumption of crude dry bauxite and metallurgical-grade alumina during the first 9 months of 2021 were $32 per ton, 19% more than that in the same period in 2020, and $450 per ton, 18% more than that in the same period of 2020, respectively.In April 2021, a 2.8-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Shanxi Province, China, restarted production after being shut down in May 2019 after a spill from its red mud disposal impoundment. Flooding in Henan Province, China, was cited for several alumina refineries shutting down production for about 2 weeks in July. Environmental and safety audits were cited for several alumina refineries and bauxite mines shutting down production in several locations in China throughout the year, and production was not expected to restart at some locations until 2022. In Indonesia, a new 1-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery started production and shipped its first product in July. In July, a 3.5-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Brazil temporarily shut down about one-third of its capacity citing damage to equipment used to unload bauxite, but production was restarted in early October. In August, a 1.42-million-ton-per- year alumina refinery in Jamaica temporarily shut down after a fire caused major damage to its powerhouse.'","'Bauxite resources are estimated to be between 55 billion and 75 billion tons, distributed in Africa (32%), Oceania (23%), South America and the Caribbean (21%), Asia (18%), and elsewhere (6%). Domestic resources of bauxite are inadequate to meet long-term U.S. demand, but the United States and most other major aluminum-producing countries have essentially inexhaustible subeconomic resources of aluminum in materials other than bauxite.'","'Bauxite is the only raw material used in the production of alumina on a commercial scale in the United States. Although currently not economically competitive with bauxite, vast resources of clay are technically feasible sources of alumina. Other raw materials, such as alunite, anorthosite, coal wastes, and oil shales, offer additional potential alumina sources. Synthetic mullite, produced from kaolin, bauxitic kaolin, kyanite, and sillimanite, substitutes for bauxite-based refractories. Silicon carbide and alumina zirconia can substitute for alumina and bauxite in abrasives but cost more.'"
