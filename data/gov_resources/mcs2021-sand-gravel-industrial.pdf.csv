1000 MT,,2019,2020,"'In 2020, industrial sand and gravel valued at about $3.2 billion was produced by about 180 companies from about 280 operations in 34 States. The value of production of industrial sand and gravel in 2020 decreased by 40% compared with that of the previous year, owing primarily to reduced demand for hydraulic- fracturing sand and metallurgical uses. Demand declined as a result of restrictions put in place in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic coupled with ongoing weak demand from the oil and gas sector. Leading producing States were Texas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Mississippi, North Carolina, Louisiana, and lowa, in descending order of tonnage produced. Combined production from these States accounted for about 81% of total domestic sales and use. About 58% of the U.S. tonnage was used as hydraulic-fracturing sand and well-packing and cementing sand; as glassmaking sand and as other whole-grain silica, 12% each; as foundry sand, 4%; as ceramics, whole-grain fillers for building products, and recreational sand, 3% each; and as other ground silica, 2%. Abrasives, chemicals, fillers, filtration sand, metallurgical flux, roofing granules, silica gravel, and traction sand, combined, accounted for the remaining 3% of industrial sand and gravel end uses.'","'Some foundry sand is recycled, and recycled cullet (pieces of glass) represents a significant proportion of reused silica. About 34% of glass containers are recycled.'","'U.S. apparent consumption of industrial sand and gravel was estimated to be 68 million tons in 2020, a 38% decrease from that of the previous year. The primary causes of the decline were decreased natural gas and petroleum well drilling in North America and oil well completion activity. These decreases were exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which resulted in a significant decline in consumption of petroleum products, which in turn prompted a decrease in demand for hydraulic-fracturing sand in 2020 compared with that of the previous year. Imports of industrial sand and gravel in 2020 were about 380,000 tonsslightly less than those of 2019. Imports of silica are generally of two typessmall shipments of very high-purity silica or a few large shipments of lower grade silica shipped only under special circumstances (for example, very low freight rates). The United States remained a net exporter of industrial sand and gravel, although U.S. exports of industrial sand and gravel decreased by 34% in 2020 compared with those of 2019, also a result of the global pandemic. The United States was the worlds leading producer and consumer of industrial sand and gravel based on estimated world production figures. It is difficult to collect definitive data on industrial sand and gravel (sometimes also referred to as silica sand and gravel) production in most nations because of the wide range of terminology and specifications used by different countries. The United States remained a major exporter of industrial sand and gravel, shipping it to almost every region of the world. High global demand for U.S. industrial sand and gravel can be attributed to the high quality and advanced processing techniques used in the United States for many grades of industrial sand and gravel, meeting specifications for virtually any use.The duration and outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, but it is likely that the performance of the industrial sand and gravel industry will continue to be negatively affected, although natural gas and petroleum well drilling activity began to recover in the latter part of the year, indicating that demand for hydraulic-fracturing sand may increase also. The effects of the pandemic were felt throughout the industry with employment declining in the industry and several companies filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection during the year. Additionally, the industrial sand and gravel industry continued to be concerned with safety and health regulations and environmental restrictions in 2020, especially those concerning crystalline silica exposure. In 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) finalized regulations to further restrict exposure to crystalline silica at quarry sites and in other industries that use materials containing it. Phased implementation of the new regulations was scheduled to take effect through 2021, affecting various industries that use materials containing silica. Local shortages of industrial sand and gravel were expected to continue to increase owing to land development priorities, local zoning regulations, and logistical issues, including ongoing development and permitting of operations producing hydraulic-fracturing sand. Natural gas and petroleum operations that use hydraulic fracturing may also undergo increased scrutiny. These factors may result in future sand and gravel operations being located farther from high- population centers. '","'Sand and gravel resources of the world are large. However, because of their geographic distribution, environmental restrictions, and quality requirements for some uses, extraction of these resources is sometimes uneconomic. Quartz-rich sand and sandstone, the main sources of industrial silica sand, occur throughout the world.'","'Alternative materials that can be used for glassmaking and for foundry and molding sands are chromite, olivine, staurolite, and zircon sands. Although costlier and mostly used in deeper wells, alternative materials that can be used as proppants are sintered bauxite and kaolin-based ceramic proppants.'"
