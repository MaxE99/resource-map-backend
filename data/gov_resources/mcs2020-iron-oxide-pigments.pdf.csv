MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'Iron oxide pigments (IOPs) were mined domestically by two companies in two States. Mine production, which was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data, decreased in 2019 from that of 2018. Five companies, including the two producers of natural IOPs, processed and sold about 38,000 tons of finished natural and synthetic IOPs with an estimated value of $52 million, significantly below the most recent sales peak of 88,100 tons in 2007. About 59% of natural and synthetic finished IOPs were used in concrete and other construction materials; 11% in plastics; 7% in coatings and paints; 5% in foundry sands and other foundry uses; 3% each in animal food, industrial chemicals, and glass and ceramics; and 9% in other uses.'",'None.',"'In 2019, domestic mine production of crude ntural |OPs decreased owing to a major producer reducing mine output to draw down stocks after excess crude production in 2016 and 2017. Production and sales of finished natural and synthetic |OPs decreased by about 21%. Production and sales of synthetic |OPs also decreased in 2019, owing in part to a decrease in natural-disaster-related construction and refurbishment projects. In the United States, residential construction, in which IOPs are commonly used to color concrete block and brick, ready-mixed concrete, and roofing tiles, remained about the same during the first 9 months of 2019 compared with that of the same period in 2018. Housing starts decreased slightly. Exports of pigment-grade IOPs decreased by about 11% during the first 9 months of 2019 compared with that during the same period in 2018, mostly owing to a significant decrease in exports to Malaysia, the Netherlands, and Thailand. More than 87% of pigment-grade IOPs went to Mexico, China, Belgium, Chile, Brazil, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Germany, in descending order of quantity. Exports of other grades of iron oxides and hydroxides, nearly double those of pigment grade, increased by about 47% during the first 9 months of 2019 compared with those of the same period in 2018. About 98% of exports of other grades of iron oxides and hydroxides went to Spain, Canada, China, Mexico, Israel, Argentina, and Australia in descending order of quantity. Total imports of natural and synthetic IOPs decreased slightly in 2019 compared with those in 2018.'",'Domestic and world resources for production of IOPs are adequate. Adequate resources are available worldwide for the manufacture of synthetic IOPs.',"'Milled |OPs are thought to be the most commonly used natural minerals for pigments. Because IOPs are color stable, low cost, and nontoxic, they can be economically used for imparting black, brown, red, and yellow coloring in large and relatively low-value applications. Other minerals may be used as colorants, but they generally cannot compete with IOPs because of their higher costs and more limited availability. Synthetic |OPs are widely used as colorants and compete with natural IOPs in many color applications. Organic colorants are used for some colorant applications, but many of the organic compounds fade over time from exposure to sunlight.'"
