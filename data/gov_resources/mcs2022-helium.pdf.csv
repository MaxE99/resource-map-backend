MCM,,2020,2021,2021,"'The estimated value of Grade-A helium (99.997% or greater) extracted during 2021 by private industry was about $540 million. Fifteen plants (one in Arizona, two in Colorado, five in Kansas, one in New Mexico, one in Oklahoma, four in Texas, and one in Utah) extracted helium from natural gas and produced crude helium that ranged from 50% to 99% helium. One plant in Colorado and another in Wyoming extracted helium from natural gas and produced Grade-A helium. Three plants in Kansas and one in Oklahoma accepted crude helium from other producers and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) pipeline and purified it to Grade-A helium. In 2021, estimated domestic apparent consumption of Grade-A helium was 40 million cubic meters (1.4 billion cubic feet), and it was used for, in descending order by estimated quantity, magnetic resonance imaging, lifting gas, analytical and laboratory applications, electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, welding, engineering and scientific applications, and various other minor applications.'","'In the United States, helium used in large-volume applications is seldom recycled. Some low-volume or liquid boil-off recovery systems are used. In the rest of the world, helium recycling is more common.'","'Helium production in 2021 decreased in the United States owing to several unplanned shutdowns taking place, including the BLM Crude Helium Enrichment Unit. As of September 2021, the BLM completed sales of the remaining Federal helium inventory and transferred responsibility for the sale of the remaining assets to the General Services Administration. Federal in-kind users were to have access to helium until September 30, 2022. In Russia, a 60-million-cubic-meter-per-year helium-processing plant was commissioned. The first of three 20-million-cubic-meter-per-year trains started production in fall 2021; the next train was scheduled to be completed in February 2022. On November 9, 2021, a proposed revised U.S. critical minerals list was published in the Federal Register (86 FR 62199). The new list contained 50 individual mineral commodities; proposed changes were the addition of nickel and zinc and the removal of helium, potash, rhenium, strontium, and uranium, which were included in the 2018 critical minerals list.'","'""Section 16 of Public Law 113-40 required the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to complete a national helium gas assessment. The USGS and the BLM coordinated efforts to complete this assessment, which was published by the USGS in fall 2021.1 The mean volume of recoverable helium within the known geologic natural gas reservoirs in the United States was estimated to be 8,490 million cubic meters (306 billion cubic feet). This does not include the remaining 85.7 million cubic meters (3 billion cubic feet) in the Federal helium inventory. The estimated mean for the Alaska region was 1.11 million cubic meters (0.04 billion cubic feet); the Gulf Coast region, 12.5 million cubic meters (0.45 billion cubic feet); the Midcontinent region, 4,330 million cubic meters (156 billion cubic feet); the North Central region, 52.7 million cubic meters (1.9 billion cubic feet); and the Rocky Mountain region 4,110 million cubic meters (148 billion cubic feet). Helium resources of the world, exclusive of the United States, were estimated to be about 31.3 billion cubic meters (1.13 trillion cubic feet). The locations and volumes of the major deposits, in billion cubic meters, are Qatar, 10.1; Algeria, 8.2; Russia, 6.8; Canada, 2.0; and China, 1.1. As of December 31, 2021, the BLM had analyzed about 22,720 gas samples from the United States and 26 other countries in a program to identify world helium resources.'","'Nothing substitutes for helium in cryogenic applications if temperatures below -429 degrees Fahrenheit are required. Argon can be substituted for helium in welding, and hydrogen can be substituted for helium in some lighter-than-air applications in which the flammable nature of hydrogen is not objectionable. Hydrogen is also being investigated as a substitute for helium in deep-sea diving applications below 305 meters (1,000 feet).'"
