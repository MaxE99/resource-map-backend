MT,"Domestically, scandium was neither mined nor recovered from process streams or mine tailings in 2019. Previously, scandium was produced domestically primarily from the scandium-yttrium silicate mineral thortveitite and from byproduct leach solutions from uranium operations. Limited capacity to produce ingot and distilled scandium metal existed at facilities in Ames, IA; Tolleson, AZ; and Urbana, IL. The principal source for scandium metal and scandium compounds was imports from China. The principal uses for scandium in 2019 were in aluminum-scandium alloys and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Other uses for scandium included ceramics, electronics, lasers, lighting, and radioactive isotopes.",None.,"The global supply and consumption of scandium was estimated to be about 15 tons to 20 tons per year. Scandium was recovered from titanium, zirconium, cobalt, and nickel process streams. China, the Philippines, and Russia were the leading producers. Prices quoted for scandium oxide in the United States decreased compared with those in 2018. Owing in part to low capacity utilization, Chinas ex-works prices for scandium oxide were significantly less than United States quoted prices. Although global exploration and development projects continued in anticipation of increased demand, the global scandium market remained small relative to most other metals.In the United States, a feasibility study was completed on the polymetallic Elk Creek project in Nebraska. Probable reserves were estimated to be 36 million tons containing 65.7 parts per million (2,400 tons) of scandium. Plans for the project included downstream production of ferroniobium, titanium dioxide, and scandium oxide. The Bokan project in Alaska and the Round Top project in Texas also included scandium recovery in their process plans. In addition, Federal and State agencies were funding the development of methods to separate scandium from coal and coal byproducts. Globally, several projects were under development while seeking permitting, project financing, and offtake agreements. Reserves at the Nyngan project in New South Wales, Australia, were estimated to be 1.4 million tons containing about 590 tons of scandium. The developer expected to begin commissioning 38.5 tons per year of scandium oxide production capacity in 2021. A definitive feasibility study on the polymetallic Owendale Project in New South Wales was completed in 2018 with the potential to produce 20 tons per year of scandium oxide from reserves of 4.0 million tons containing 570 parts per million scandium (3,500 tons of scandium oxide equivalent). Engineering and design plans for the polymetallic Sunrise Project in New South Wales, continued to advance following an offtake agreement for nickel and cobalt in 2019 and the completion of a definitive feasibility study in 2018. Proven and probable reserves for the Sunrise Project were 147 million tons containing 53 parts per million (7,800 t) scandium. In Queensland, following the completion of a bankable feasibility study on the polymetallic SCONI project in 2018, reserves were updated to 57 million tons containing 35 parts per million (2,000 tons) scandium. In the Philippines, a plant designed to recover 7.5 tons per year of scandium oxide equivalent began commercial production at the Taganito high-pressure acid-leach nickel operation. An intermediate scandium concentrate was exported to Japan. In Russia, feasibility studies for making scandium oxide as a byproduct of alumina refining in the Ural Mountains were ongoing. The pilot plant was reported to have produced scandium oxide with purity greater than 99%. Based on pilot test results, plans were in place for a 3-ton-per-year scandium oxide plant. In Dalur, Kurgan region, development of scandium recovery as a byproduct of uranium production continued, and production capacity included scandium oxide (570 kilograms per year) and aluminum-scandium alloy (24.5 tons per year). In the European Union, recovery methods were being developed to produce scandium compounds and aluminum- scandium alloys from byproducts of aluminum and titanium mining and processing. Globally, several projects were underway to commercialize new aluminum-scandium alloys for casting and additive manufacturing.","Resources of scandium are abundant. Scandiums crustal abundance is greater than that of lead. Scandium lacks affinity for the common ore-forming anions; therefore, it is widely dispersed in the lithosphere and forms solid solutions with low concentrations in more than 100 minerals. Scandium resources have been identified in Australia, Canada, China, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States","Titanium and aluminum high-strength alloys, as well as carbon-fiber materials, may substitute in high- performance scandium-alloy applications. Light-emitting diodes displace mercury-vapor high-intensity lights in some industrial and residential applications. In some applications that rely on scandiums unique properties, substitution is not possible."
