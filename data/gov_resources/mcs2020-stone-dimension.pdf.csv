1000 MT,,2018.0,2019.0,"'Approximately 2.7 million tons of dimension stone, valued at $440 million, was sold or used by U.S. producers in 2019. Dimension stone was produced by 197 companies operating 250 quarries in 33 States. Leading producer States were, in descending order by tonnage, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, Georgia, and Vermont. These five States accounted for about 68% of the production quantity and contributed about 56% of the value of domestic production. Approximately 50%, by tonnage, of dimension stone sold or used was limestone, followed by sandstone (20%), granite (18%), miscellaneous stone (8%), and marble and slate (2% each). By value, the leading sales or uses were for limestone (45%), followed by granite (25%), sandstone (11%), miscellaneous stone (9%), slate (6%), and marble (4%). Rough stone represented 54% of the tonnage and 47% of the value of all the dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, including exports. The leading uses and distribution of rough stone, by tonnage, were in building and construction (53%) and in irregular-shaped stone (35%). The leading uses and distribution of dressed stone, by tonnage, were in ashlars and partially squared pieces (41%), slabs and blocks for building and construction (12%), and curbing (11%).'","'Small amounts of dimension stone were recycled, principally by restorers of old stone work.'","'The United States remained one of the worlds leading markets for dimension stone. In 2019, total imports of dimension stone decreased in value by about 9% compared with the value in 2018. In 2019, steady activity in new residential construction resulted in a slight increase in domestic production of dimension stone compared with that of the previous year. Dimension stone for construction and refurbishment was used in commercial and residential markets; in 2019, the renovation market for existing homes remained steady and unchanged compared with that in the previous year. Dimension stone exports decreased to about $60 million. Apparent consumption, by value, was estimated to be $2.3 billion in 2019a 7% decrease compared with that of 2018. The dimension stone industry continued to be concerned with safety and health regulations and environmental restrictions in 2019, especially those concerning crystalline silica exposure. Beginning in 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) finalized new regulations to further restrict exposure to crystalline silica at quarry sites and other industries that use materials containing it. Phased implementation of the new regulations was scheduled to take effect through 2021, affecting various industries that use materials containing silica. Most provisions of the new regulations became enforceable on June 23, 2018, for general industry and maritime operations. On August 14, 2019, OSHA requested comment and information to enable the agency to consider new developments and enhanced control methods for equipment that generates exposures to silica. '",'Dimension stone resources of the world are sufficient. Resources can be limited on a local level or occasionally on a regional level by the lack of a particular kind of stone that is suitable for dimension purposes.',"'Substitutes for dimension stone include aluminum, brick, ceramic tile, concrete, glass, plastics, resin- agglomerated stone, and steel.'"
