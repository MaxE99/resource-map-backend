1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,2020.0,2021.0,2021.0,"'In 2021, one company recovered ilmenite and rutile concentrates from its surface- mining operations near Nahunta, GA, and Starke, FL. A second company processed existing mine tailings to recover a mixed heavy-mineral concentrate in South Carolina. Based on reported data through September, the estimated value of titanium mineral and synthetic concentrates imported into the United States in 2021 was $690 million. Abrasive sands, monazite, and zircon were coproducts of domestic titanium minerals mining operations. An estimated 95% of titanium mineral concentrates were consumed by domestic TiOz pigment producers. The remaining 5% was used in welding-rod coatings and for manufacturing carbides, chemicals, and titanium metal.'",'None.',"'Consumption of titanium mineral concentrates is tied to production of TiO2 pigments that are primarily used in paint, paper, and plastics. Demand for these primary uses is related to changes in the gross domestic product. Domestic apparent consumption of titanium mineral concentrates in 2021 was estimated to have increased significantly from that in 2020 when apparent consumption was affected by a downturn in economic activity owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Inventory changes were not included in the apparent consumption calculation. Exports of titanium mineral concentrates were small compared with apparent consumption. As of September, South Africa (27%), Madagascar (18%), Australia (15%), and Mozambique (15%) were the leading sources of titanium mineral concentrates imports to the United States. Mining and heavy-mineral-processing operations were expanded near Starke, FL, and prefeasibility studies were underway at the Titan heavy-mineral- sands project near Camden, TN. In 2021, China continued to be the leading producer and consumer of titanium mineral concentrates, accounting for 37% of global production of ilmenite. Mozambique and South Africa also were leading producers of titanium mineral concentrates. Chinas imports of titanium mineral concentrates were about 3.6 million tons in gross weight, an increase of 21% compared with those in 2020. As of October, Mozambique (32%), Australia (14%), Vietnam (13%), and Kenya (9%) were the leading sources of titanium mineral concentrates to China. In Saudi Arabia, commissioning of a project to produce up to 500,000 tons per year of titanium slag was delayed by technical problems and supply constraints resulting from COVID-19 restrictions. Other projects were being developed in Australia, China, Malawi, Mozambique, Norway, Senegal, and Tanzania. '","'Ilmenite accounts for about 90% of the worlds consumption of titanium minerals. World resources of anatase, ilmenite, and rutile total more than 2 billion tons. '","'Ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, slag, and synthetic rutile compete as feedstock sources for producing TiOz pigment, titanium metal, and welding-rod coatings.'"
