MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'Byproduct vanadium production in Utah from the mining of uraniferous sandstones on the Colorado Plateau ceased in early 2020 and was not restarted in 2021. Secondary vanadium production continued in Arkansas and Ohio where processed waste materials (petroleum residues, spent catalysts, and utility ash) were used to produce ferrovanadium, vanadium-bearing chemicals or specialty alloys, and vanadium pentoxide. Two additional secondary producers in Pennsylvania and Texas remained idle. Metallurgical use, primarily as an alloying agent for iron and steel, accounted for about 94% of domestic reported vanadium consumption in 2021. Of the other uses for vanadium, the major nonmetallurgical use was in catalysts to produce maleic anhydride and sulfuric acid.'",'The quantity of vanadium recycled from spent chemical process catalysts was significant and may compose as much as 40% of total vanadium catalysts.',"'U.S. apparent consumption of vanadium in 2021 increased by 25% from that in 2020. The estimated average Chinese vanadium pentoxide price in 2021 increased by 22% compared with the 2020 price, and the estimated United States ferrovanadium price increased by 51% to $16.30 per pound in 2021 compared with that in 2020. Governments globally announced different measures to revive their economies after they were negatively affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic. China continued to be the worlds top vanadium producer, producing the majority of its vanadium from vanadiferous iron ore processed for steel production. In response to the global pandemic, Chinas Government implemented stimulus measures which led to record steel production in China. As a result, Chinese steel mills used more domestic titaniferous magnetite ore and resulted in Chinese producers operating at near capacity. Despite the significant increase in vanadium slag production in China, several environmental restrictions by Chinas Government to cut pollution may impose further constraints on vanadium slag production at steel plants. The limited capacity of vanadium-producing steel plants was expected to continue to cause vanadium prices to fluctuate. In the third quarter of 2021, a producer in Brazil announced the commissioning of a vanadium trioxide processing plant at its Maracas Menchen Mine. The company emphasized that its decision to include production of high purity vanadium would be key to supporting its vanadium redox flow battery technology business. A vanadium producer in South Africa announced that it was completing an expanded prefeasibility study of its facility to determine the most- capital-efficient manner to increase vanadium production. It aimed to increase its facilitys capacity by approximately 50% by yearend 2022 and more than double capacity in the long term if market conditions continued to improve.'","'World resources of vanadium exceed 63 million tons. Vanadium occurs in deposits of phosphate rock, titaniferous magnetite, and uraniferous sandstone and siltstone, in which it constitutes less than 2% of the host rock. Significant quantities are also present in bauxite and carboniferous materials, such as coal, crude oil, oil shale, and tar sands. Because vanadium is typically recovered as a byproduct or coproduct, demonstrated world resources of the element are not fully indicative of available supplies. Although domestic resources and secondary recovery are adequate to supply a large portion of domestic needs, almost all of U.S. demand is currently met by foreign sources.'","'Steels containing various combinations of other alloying elements can be substituted for steels containing vanadium. Certain metals, such as manganese, molybdenum, niobium (columbium), titanium, and tungsten, are to some degree interchangeable with vanadium as alloying elements in steel. Platinum and nickel can replace vanadium compounds as catalysts in some chemical processes. Currently, no acceptable substitute for vanadium is available for use in aerospace titanium alloys.'"
