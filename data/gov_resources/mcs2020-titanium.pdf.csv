MT,,2018,2019,2018,2019,"'Titanium sponge metal was produced by two operations in Nevada and Utah. Production data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The facility in Salt Lake City, UT, with an estimated capacity of 500 tons per year, used the Armstrong method to produce high-purity titanium for use in electronics. The operations in Nevada, with an estimated capacity of 12,600 tons per year, used the Kroll method, the dominant process of titanium sponge production for use in aerospace, industrial, and all other applications. A third facility, in Rowley, UT, with an estimated capacity of 10,900 tons per year, was using the Kroll method until it was idled and placed on care-and-maintenance status in 2016 owing to market conditions. In 2019, an estimated 80% of titanium metal was used in aerospace applications; the remaining 20% was used in armor, chemical processing, marine hardware, medical implants, power generation, and consumer and other applications. Assuming an average purchase price of $9.10 per kilogram, the value of sponge metal consumed was about $320 million. In 2019, titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment production, by four companies operating five facilities in four States, was valued at about $3.0 billion. The estimated end-use distribution of TiO2 pigment consumption was paints (including lacquers and varnishes), 59%; plastics, 20%; paper, 5%; and other, 16%. Other uses of TiO2 included catalysts, ceramics, coated fabrics and textiles, floor coverings, printing ink, and roofing granules.'","'About 62,000 tons of titanium scrap metal was consumed in 201950,000 tons by the titanium industry, 10,000 tons by the steel industry, 500 tons by the superalloy industry, and the remainder in other industries.'","'Domestic consumption of titanium sponge in 2019 was essentially unchanged compared with that of 2018. Increased imports outpaced increased exports of titanium sponge leading to an increase in net import reliance to 86%. Japan and Kazakhstan were the leading import sources for titanium sponge. Domestic production of TiO2 pigment in 2019 was estimated to be about 1.1 million tons, a decrease from that of 2018. Although heavily reliant on imports of titanium mineral concentrates, the United States was a net exporter of TiO2 pigments. Following a settlement reached with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, a leading global producer of titanium minerals and pigments based in the United States acquired the second-ranked global producer of titanium pigments headquartered in Saudi Arabia. One key requirement of the approval was the divesture of two titanium pigment plants in Ashtabula, OH. In Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, a new titanium sponge operation was being commissioned, but was delayed by technical issues. The new facility was jointly owned by companies based in Saudi Arabia and Japan and was expected to produce up to 15,600 tons per year of titanium sponge.'",'Reserves and resources of titanium minerals are discussed in the Titanium Mineral Concentrates chapter.',"'Few materials possess titanium metals strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. In high- strength applications, titanium competes with aluminum, composites, intermetallics, steel, and superalloys. Aluminum, nickel, specialty steels, and zirconium alloys may be substituted for titanium for applications that require corrosion resistance. Ground calcium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate, kaolin, and talc compete with titanium dioxide as a white pigment.'"
