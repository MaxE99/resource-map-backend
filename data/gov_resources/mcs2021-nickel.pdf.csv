MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'In 2020, the underground Eagle Mine in Michigan produced approximately 16,000 tons of nickel in concentrate, which was exported to smelters in Canada and overseas. A company in Missouri recovered metals, including nickel, from mine tailings as part of the Superfund Redevelopment Initiative. Nickel in crystalline sulfate was produced as a byproduct of smelting and refining platinum-group-metal ores mined in Montana. In the United States, the leading uses for primary nickel are stainless and alloy steels, nonferrous alloys and superalloys, electroplating, and other uses including catalysts and chemicals. Stainless and alloy steel and nickel- containing alloys typically account for more than 85% of domestic consumption.'","""Nickel in alloyed form was recovered from the processing of nickel-containing waste, including flue dust, grinding swarf, mill scale, and shot blast generated during the manufacturing of stainless steel; filter cakes, plating solutions, spent catalysts, spent pickle liquor, sludges, and all types of spent nickel-containing batteries. Nickel- containing alloys and stainless-steel scrap were also melted and used to produce new alloys and stainless steel. The U.S. Department of Energy's ReCell Center continued to investigate methods to more effectively recover raw materials, including nickel, from recycled batteries. In 2020, recycled nickel in all forms accounted for approximately 50% of apparent consumption.""","'Domestic reported consumption of primary nickel decreased by an estimated 20% in 2020, owing primarily to reduced demand related to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 70% of the decrease was attributed to reduced consumption of nickel alloys, primarily those used in the aviation and oil and gas sectors. Domestic production of stainless steel and related nickel consumption decreased substantially in the first half of 2020, but most of the leading domestic stainless-steel producers reported relatively robust recovery in the third quarter. Total domestic production of stainless steel in 2020 was estimated to have decreased by approximately 10%. Globally, nickel mine production was estimated to have decreased by 5%. Although stainless-steel production in most leading producing countries and (or) localities decreased, these were mostly offset by a rapid recovery in Chinas production of nickel-bearing stainless-steel grades after the first quarter, and the continued rampup of nickel pig iron and stainless-steel projects in Indonesia. '","'Identified land-based resources averaging approximately 0.5% nickel or greater contain at least 300 million tons of nickel, with about 60% in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits. Extensive nickel resources also are found in manganese crusts and nodules on the ocean floor.'","'Low-nickel, duplex, or ultrahigh-chromium stainless steels have been substituted for austenitic grades in construction. Nickel-free specialty steels are sometimes used in place of stainless steel in the power-generating and petrochemical industries. Titanium alloys can substitute for nickel metal or nickel-base alloys in corrosive chemical environments. Lithium-ion batteries may be used instead of nickel metal hydride batteries in certain applications.'"
