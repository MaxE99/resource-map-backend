MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'In 2019, garnet for industrial use was mined by four firmsone in Idaho, one in Montana, and two in New York. One processing facility operated in Pennsylvania and another opened in Oregon in June. The estimated value of crude garnet production was about $21 million, and refined material sold or used had an estimated value of $62 million. The major end uses of garnet were, in descending percentage of consumption, for abrasive blasting, water-filtration media, water-jet-assisted cutting, and other end uses, such as in abrasive powders, nonslip coatings, and sandpaper. Domestic industries that consume garnet include aircraft and motor vehicle manufacturers, ceramics and glass producers, electronic component manufacturers, filtration plants, glass polishing, the petroleum industry, shipbuilders, textile stonewashing, and wood-furniture-finishing operations.'","'Garnet was recycled in Pennsylvania at a plant with a recycling capacity of 25,000 tons per year and ata new plant in Oregon, with a recycling capacity of 16,000 tons per year, that opened in June 2019. Garnet can be recycled multiple times without degradation of its quality. Most recycled garnet is from blast cleaning and water-jet- assisted cutting operations.'","'During 2019, estimated domestic production of crude garnet concentrates decreased by 8% compared with production in 2018. U.S. garnet production was estimated to be about 8% of total global garnet production. The 2019 estimated domestic sales or use of refined garnet decreased by 12% compared with sales in 2018. This decrease was thought to have taken place because of high quantities of industry stocks of garnet and decreased crude garnet production and imports into the United States. Garnet imports in 2019 were estimated to have decreased by 29% compared with those in 2018. Most of the decrease was attributed to a lack of imports of garnet from South Africa, owing to the Pennsylvania processing facility reaching its storage capacity. Imports from India remained steady and continued to recover from previous export restrictions. Imports from China increased and somewhat offset the decrease from South Africa. In 2019, the average unit value of garnet imports was $250 per ton, an increase of 19% compared with the average unit value in 2018. In the United States, most domestically produced crude garnet concentrate was priced at about $230 per ton. U.S. exports in 2019 were estimated to have decreased by 15%. The United States consumed about 22% of global garnet production and world production of garnet decreased by 4% in 2019. Garnet production increased in Australia and China; garnet production decreased in India and South Africa. The garnet market is very competitive. To increase profitability and remain competitive with imported material, production may be restricted to only high-grade garnet ores or as a byproduct of other salable mineral products that occur with garnet, such as kyanite, marble, metallic ores, mica minerals, sillimanite, staurolite, or wollastonite. '","'World resources of garnet are large and occur in a wide variety of rocks, particularly gneisses and schists. Garnet also occurs in contact-metamorphic deposits in crystalline limestones, pegmatites, serpentinites, and vein deposits. In addition, alluvial garnet is present in many heavy-mineral sand and gravel deposits throughout the world. Large domestic resources of garnet also are concentrated in coarsely crystalline gneiss near North Creek, NY; other significant domestic resources of garnet occur in Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Oregon. In addition to those in the United States, major garnet deposits exist in Australia, Canada, China, India, and South Africa, where they are mined for foreign and domestic markets; deposits in Russia and Turkey also have been mined in recent years, primarily for internal markets. Additional garnet resources are in Chile, Czechia, Pakistan, Spain, Thailand, and Ukraine; small mining operations have been reported in most of these countries.'","'Other natural and manufactured abrasives can substitute to some extent for all major end uses of garnet. In many cases, however, using the substitutes would entail sacrifices in quality or cost. Fused aluminum oxide and staurolite compete with garnet as a sandblasting material. IImenite, magnetite, and plastics compete as filtration media. Corundum, diamond, and fused aluminum oxide compete for lens grinding and for many lapping operations. Emery is a substitute in nonskid surfaces. Fused aluminum oxide, quartz sand, and silicon carbide compete for the finishing of plastics, wood furniture, and other products.'"
