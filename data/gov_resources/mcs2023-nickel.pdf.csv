MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'In 2022, the underground Eagle Mine in Michigan produced approximately 18,000 tons of nickel in concentrate, which was exported to smelters in Canada and overseas. Nickel in crystalline sulfate was produced as a byproduct of smelting and refining platinum-group-metal ores mined in Montana. In Missouri, a company produced nickel-copper-cobalt concentrate from historic mine tailings and was building a hydrometallurgical processing plant near the mine site. A nickel beneficiation project was to be built in North Dakota using $115 million awarded from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In the United States, the leading uses for primary nickel are alloys and steels, electroplating, and other uses including catalysts and chemicals. Stainless and alloy steel and nickel-containing alloys typically account for more than 85% of domestic consumption. '","'Most secondary nickel was in the form of nickel content of stainless-steel scrap. Nickel in alloyed form was recovered from the processing of nickel-containing waste. Most recycled nickel was used to produce new alloys and stainless steel. In 2022, as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, more than $600 million was allocated to projects to recover nickel from spent lithium-ion batteries and for the synthesis of nickel-containing precursor and cathode active materials. In 2022, recycled nickel in all forms accounted for approximately 56% of apparent consumption.'","'In 2022, the annual average LME nickel cash price was estimated to have increased by 35% compared with that in 2021 which was attributed to increasing use of nickel in electric vehicle batteries and continued strong demand for stainless steel. Nickel prices were particularly volatile early in the year. In March, after the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, prices surged, which disrupted nickel trading on the LME for approximately two weeks. Monthly average prices peaked in March, but began to decline through July, and stabilized for the remainder of the year. Estimated global nickel mine production increased by about 20%, with almost all of the increased production attributed to Indonesia. The largest share of the increase was facilitated by the ongoing commissioning of integrated nickel pig iron and stainless-steel projects. In addition, several companies continued to develop projects to produce intermediate matte or mixed nickel-cobalt hydroxide that were intended to be used as feedstock to produce battery- grade nickel sulfate. On February 24, 2022, a U.S. critical minerals list was published in the Federal Register (87 FR 10381). The changes in the 2022 list from the prior list published in 2018 (83 FR 23295) were the addition of nickel and zinc and the removal of helium, potash, rhenium, strontium, and uranium. The list is to be updated every 3 years and revised as necessary consistent with available data. '","'* Identified land-based resources averaging approximately 0.5% nickel or greater contain at least 300 million tons of nickel, with about 60% in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits. Extensive nickel resources also are found in manganese crusts and nodules on the ocean floor.'","'Low-nickel, duplex, or ultrahigh-chromium stainless steels have been substituted for austenitic grades in construction. Nickel-free specialty steels are sometimes used in place of stainless steel in the power-generating and petrochemical industries. Titanium alloys can substitute for nickel metal or nickel-base alloys in corrosive chemical environments.'"
