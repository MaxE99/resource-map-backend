1000 MT,,2020,2021,2020,2021,2020,2021,"'Production of clays (sold or used) in the United States was estimated to be 25 million tons valued at $1.5 billion in 2021, with about 120 companies operating clay and shale mines in 38 States. The leading 20 companies produced approximately 65% of the U.S. tonnage and 84% of the value for all types of clay. Principal domestic uses for specific clays were estimated to be as follows: ball clay50% floor and wall tile and 18% sanitaryware; bentonite50% pet waste absorbents and 22% drilling mud; common clay45% brick, 28% lightweight aggregate, and 22% cement; fire clay82% heavy clay and lightweight aggregates products (for example, brick, cement, and concrete) and 14% refractory products and miscellaneous uses; fullers earth81% absorbents (includes oil and grease absorbents, pet waste absorbents, and miscellaneous absorbents); and kaolin30% paper coating and filling, 15% miscellaneous ceramics, and 15% refractory products. Exports of clay and shale were estimated have increased by 16% in 2021 after decreasing by 13% in 2020. In 2021, the United States exported an estimated 800,000 tons of bentonite with Canada, Japan, and China, in decreasing order, being the leading destinations. About 2.3 million tons of kaolin was exported mainly as a paper coating and filler; a component in ceramic bodies; and fillers and extenders in paint, plastic, and rubber products, with China, Mexico, and Japan, in decreasing order, being the leading destinations. Lesser quantities of ball clay, fire clay, and fullers earth were exported for ceramic, refractory, and absorbent uses, respectively.'",'Insignificant.',"'In October 2021, a common clay producer headquartered in Tennessee finalized the acquisition of another common clay company headquartered in Georgia, which operated 20 plants throughout North America. In July 2021, a Georgia kaolin producer announced an agreement to purchase central Georgia assets that support the paper and board industry from another kaolin producer with North American headquarters in Georgia.'",'Resources of all clays are extremely large.',"'Clays compete with calcium carbonate in filler and extender applications; diatomite, organic pet litters, polymers, silica gel, and zeolites as absorbents; and various siding and roofing types in building construction.'"
