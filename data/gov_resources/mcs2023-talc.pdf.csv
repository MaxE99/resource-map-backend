1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'Three companies operated five talc-producing mines in three States during 2022, and domestic production of crude talc was estimated to be nearly unchanged at 580,000 tons valued at $26 million. Talc was mined in Montana, Texas, and Vermont. Total sales (domestic and export) of talc by U.S. producers were estimated to be 560,000 tons valued at about $180 million. Talc produced and sold in the United States was used in paper, 23%; ceramics (including automotive catalytic converters), 18%; plastics, 18%; paint, 16%; rubber, 4%; and roofing, 2%. The remaining 19% was for agriculture, cosmetics, export, insecticides, and other miscellaneous uses. One company in North Carolina mined and processed pyrophyllite in 2021. Domestic production data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data and were estimated to have increased from those in 2021. Pyrophyllite was sold for refractory, paint, and ceramic products. '",'Insignificant.',"'Canada, China, and Pakistan were the principal sources for United States talc imports in recent years. Imports from Pakistan have increased in recent years and accounted for nearly one-half of total imports. Imports from Canada have supplied nearly one-third of the total, whereas imports from China have increased recently to about 15% of total imports. Belgium and Malaysia were the primary destinations for United States talc exports, collectively receiving about one-half of exports. Imports of talc and related materials were estimated to have increased by about 19% in 2022 compared with those in 2021, whereas exports were estimated to have decreased by at least 10%. U.S. talc consumption, imports, production, and sales increased in 2022, with estimated mine production returning to 2019 levels. Apparent consumption of talc increased as trade continued to rebound in 2022 following a decrease caused by the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The amount of talc used in paper and plastic production increased in 2021 and 2022. Ceramic tile and sanitaryware formulations and the technology for firing ceramic tile changed over recent decades, reducing the amount of talc required for the manufacture of some ceramic products. For paint, the industry shifted its focus to production of water- based paint (a product for which talc is not well suited because it is hydrophobic) from oil-based paint in order to reduce volatile emissions. The amount of talc used for paper manufacturing began to decrease beginning in the 1990s, and some talc used for pitch control was replaced by chemical agents. For cosmetics, manufacturers of body dusting powders shifted much of their production from talc-based to corn-starch-based products.'","' The United States is self-sufficient in most grades of talc and related minerals, but lower priced imports have replaced domestic minerals for some uses. Talc occurs in the United States from New England to Alabama in the Appalachian Mountains and the Piedmont region, as well as in California, Montana, Nevada, Texas, and Washington. Domestic and world identified resources are estimated to be approximately five times the quantity of reserves.'","'Substitutes for talc include bentonite, chlorite, feldspar, kaolin, and pyrophyllite in ceramics; chlorite, kaolin, and mica in paint; calcium carbonate and kaolin in paper; bentonite, kaolin, mica, and wollastonite in plastics; and kaolin and mica in rubber.'"
