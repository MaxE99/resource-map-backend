MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'In 2020, one firm recovered zircon (zirconium silicate) from surface-mining operations in Florida and Georgia as a coproduct from the mining of heavy-mineral sands and the processing of titanium and zirconium mineral concentrates, and a second company processed existing mineral sands tailings in Florida. Zirconium metal and hafnium metal were produced from zirconium chemical intermediates by one producer in Oregon and one in Utah. Zirconium and hafnium are typically contained in zircon at a ratio of about 36 to 1. Zirconium chemicals were produced by the metal producer in Oregon and by at least 10 other companies. Ceramics, foundry sand, opacifiers, and refractories are the leading end uses for zircon. Other end uses of zircon include abrasives, chemicals (predominantly, zirconium basic sulfate and zirconium oxychloride octohydrate as intermediate chemicals), metal alloys, and welding rod coatings. The leading consumers of zirconium metal are the chemical process and nuclear energy industries. The leading use of hafnium metal is in superalloys.'",'Companies in Oregon and Utah recycled zirconium from new scrap generated during metal production and fabrication and (or) from post-commercial old scrap. Zircon foundry mold cores and spent or rejected zirconia',"'The average unit value for imports of zircon concentrates decreased in 2020 after increasing for the past 3 years. Exports of zirconium ores and zircon concentrates decreased by an estimated 65% in 2020 from those in 2019. In August, new mining and heavy-mineral-processing operations were being commissioned near Jessup, GA. Global zircon production was estimated to have decreased slightly in 2020 owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced consumption, and power and labor issues. During 2020, several large mining projects containing zirconium were in development but construction had not begun on any of them. In Western Australia, two companies announced a potential joint venture that would provide the funding needed for the first stage of construction at the Thunderbird mineral sands project if final agreements and approvals were reached. Regional or national government agencies in Australia indicated that they would provide financial support, such as loans, for the Coburn mineral sands project in Western Australia and the Dubbo polymetallic project in New South Wales.'","""'Resources of zircon in the United States included about 14 million tons associated with titanium resources in heavy-mineral-sand deposits. Phosphate rock and sand and gravel deposits could potentially yield substantial amounts of zircon as a byproduct. World resources of hafnium are associated with those of zircon and baddeleyite. Quantitative estimates of hafnium resources are not available.""","'Chromite and olivine can be used instead of zircon for some foundry applications. Dolomite and spinel refractories can also substitute for zircon in certain high-temperature applications. Niobium (columbium), stainless steel, and tantalum provide limited substitution in nuclear applications, and titanium and synthetic materials may substitute in some chemical processing plant applications. Silver-cadmium-indium control rods are used in lieu of hafnium at numerous nuclear powerplants. Zirconium can be used interchangeably with hafnium in certain superalloys.'"
