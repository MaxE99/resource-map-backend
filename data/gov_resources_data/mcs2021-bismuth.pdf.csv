MT,,2019,2020,"'The United States ceased production of primary refined bismuth in 1997 and is highly import dependent for its supply. Bismuth is contained in some lead ores mined domestically. However, the last domestic primary lead smelter closed at yearend 2013; since then all lead concentrates have been exported for smelting. About three-fifths of domestic bismuth consumption was for chemicals used in cosmetic, industrial, laboratory, and pharmaceutical applications. Bismuth use in pharmaceuticals included bismuth salicylate (the active ingredient in over-the-counter stomach remedies) and other compounds used to treat burns, intestinal disorders, and stomach ulcers. Bismuth is also used in the manufacture of ceramic glazes, crystalware, and pearlescent pigments. Bismuth has a wide variety of metallurgical applications, including use as an additive to enhance metallurgical quality in the foundry industry and as a nontoxic replacement for lead in brass, free-machining steels, and solders. The use of bismuth in brass for pipe fittings, fixtures, and water meters increased after 2014 when the definition of lead-free under the Safe Drinking Water Act was modified to reduce the maximum lead content of lead-free pipes and plumbing fixtures to 0.25% from 8%. The melting point of bismuth is relatively low at 271 degrees Celsius, and it is an important component of various fusible alloys, some of which have melting points below that of boiling water. These bismuth-containing alloys can be used in holding devices for grinding optical lenses, as a temporary filler to prevent damage to tubes in bending operations, as a triggering mechanism for fire sprinklers, and in other applications in which a low melting point is ideal. Bismuth-tellurium-oxide alloy film paste is used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. '",'Bismuth-containing alloy scrap was recycled and thought to compose less than 5% of U.S. bismuth apparent consumption.',"'Bismuth prices continued a significant downward trend that began in 2014, when the annual average domestic dealer price was $11.14 per pound. Bismuth was one of the metals held in significant quantities by the defunct Fanya Nonferrous Metals Exchange in China, which closed in 2015. In December 2019, 19,200 tons of Fanya Metal Exchange bismuth stocks were sold, which was likely the cause for the price slump at the end of that year. In 2020, it was announced that the Fanya bismuth stocks would be used internally for manufacturing, which relieved downward pricing pressures seen through the first half of 2020, resulting in a slight increase in the third quarter. The global COVID-19 pandemic affected the global economy and trade during the first of half of 2020; in particular, China during the first quarter and the United States in the second quarter. Economies in both countries have showed some rebound in subsequent quarters. Trade data through August 2020 were mixed when compared with the same period in 2019while bismuth exports increased, imports for consumption decreased. '","'* World reserves of bismuth are usually estimated based on the bismuth content of lead resources because bismuth production is most often a byproduct of processing lead ores. In China and Vietnam, bismuth production is a byproduct or coproduct of tungsten and other metal ore processing. Bismuth minerals rarely occur in sufficient quantities to be mined as principal products; the Tasna Mine in Bolivia and a mine in China are the only mines where bismuth has been the primary product. The Tasna Mine has been inactive since 1996.'","'Bismuth compounds can be replaced in pharmaceutical applications by alumina, antibiotics, calcium carbonate, and magnesia. Titanium dioxide-coated mica flakes and fish-scale extracts are substitutes in pigment uses. Cadmium, indium, lead, and tin can partially replace bismuth in low-temperature solders. Resins can replace bismuth alloys for holding metal shapes during machining, and glycerine-filled glass bulbs can replace bismuth alloys in triggering devices for fire sprinklers. Free-machining alloys can contain lead, selenium, or tellurium as a replacement for bismuth. Bismuth is an environmentally friendly substitute for lead in plumbing and many other applications, including fishing weights, hunting ammunition, lubricating greases, and soldering alloys.'"
