MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'In 2020, tellurium was recovered in the United States. One company in Texas was thought to export copper anode slimes to Mexico for recovery of commercial-grade tellurium. Downstream companies further refined imported commercial-grade metal to produce tellurium dioxide, high-purity tellurium, and tellurium compounds for specialty applications. Tellurium was predominantly used in the production of cadmium telluride (CdTe) for thin-film solar cells. Another important end use was for the production of bismuth telluride (BiTe), which is used in thermoelectric devices for both cooling and energy generation. Other uses were as an alloying additive in steel to improve machining characteristics, as a minor additive in copper alloys to improve machinability without reducing conductivity, in lead alloys to improve resistance to vibration and fatigue, in cast iron to help control the depth of chill, and in malleable iron as a carbide stabilizer. It was used in the chemical industry as a vulcanizing agent and accelerator in the processing of rubber and as a component of catalysts for synthetic fiber production. Other uses included those in photoreceptor and thermoelectric devices, blasting caps, and as a pigment to produce various colors in glass and ceramics. Global consumption estimates of tellurium by end use are solar, 40%; thermoelectric production, 30%; metallurgy, 15%; rubber applications, 5%; and other, 10%'","'For traditional metallurgical and chemical uses, there was little or no old scrap from which to extract secondary tellurium because these uses of tellurium are highly dispersive or dissipative. A very small amount of tellurium was recovered from scrapped selenium-tellurium photoreceptors employed in older plain-paper copiers in Europe. A plant in the United States recycled tellurium from CdTe solar cells; however, the amount recycled was limited because most CdTe solar cells were relatively new and had not reached the end of their useful life.'","'In 2020, domestic tellurium content in anode slimes was estimated to have remained essentially unchanged from that in 2019. One domestic producer of anode slimes shipped at least a portion of its anode slimes to Mexico for treatment and refining. In 2020, the domestic average monthly price of tellurium generally decreased in the first 8 months of the year, from around $65 per kilogram in January to $55 per kilogram in August, after which the prices recovered to around $60 per kilogram in September. Domestic imports of tellurium were estimated to have decreased by about 89% in 2020 from those of 2019, mostly as a result of a significant decrease in imports from Germany and Canada. During the first 8 months of 2020, the United States imported 0.025 ton (25 kilograms) of tellurium from Germany and 1 ton of tellurium from Canada. During the same period of 2019, the United States imported 22 tons of tellurium from Germany and 2 tons of tellurium from Canada. Domestic exports of tellurium had increased significantly in 2020 which may include misclassified exports.World production of tellurium was estimated to be about 490 tons. China was the leading producer of refined tellurium, recovering tellurium from copper anode slimes and from residues generated during the lead, nickel, precious metals, and zinc smelting processes. In late 2019, the Yunnan Provincial government in China announced an auction of 170 tons of tellurium from the defunct Fanya Metal Exchange with a starting price of $43 per kilogram (306 yuan per kilogram), or a total lot bid of $7.34 million (51.95 million yuan), and the tellurium was sold in December 2019. Demand in China for CdTe for solar panels increased in 2020 owing to increased investment in solar production projects. Production of tellurium increased at a Chinese firm to 6 tons per month, up from 1 to 2 tons per month in the previous year. Exports of CdTe from China also rose in the first 6 months of 2020, rising by 6% to over 300 tons. A Canadian company announced in August that it would expand production of ultra-high purity (99.99999%) tellurium for semiconductor technologies, such as solid-state radiation detectors. Solid-state radiation detectors produce highly accurate images, and are used in healthcare, security, and military systems. '","'Data on tellurium resources were not available. More than 90% of tellurium has been produced from anode slimes collected from electrolytic copper refining, and the remainder was derived from skimmings at lead refineries and from flue dusts and gases generated during the smelting of bismuth, copper, and lead-zinc ores. Potential sources of tellurium include bismuth telluride and gold telluride ores.'","'Several materials can replace tellurium in most of its uses, but usually with losses in efficiency or product characteristics. Bismuth, calcium, lead, phosphorus, selenium, and sulfur can be used in place of tellurium in many free-machining steels. Several of the chemical process reactions catalyzed by tellurium can be carried out with other catalysts or by means of noncatalyzed processes. In rubber compounding, sulfur and (or) selenium can act as vulcanization agents in place of tellurium. The selenides and sulfides of niobium and tantalum can serve as electrical- conducting solid lubricants in place of tellurides of those metals.'"
