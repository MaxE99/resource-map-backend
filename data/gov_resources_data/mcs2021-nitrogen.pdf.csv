1000 MT,,2019,2020,"Ammonia was produced by 16 companies at 35 plants in 16 States in the United States during 2020; 2 additional plants were idle for the entire year. About 60% of total U.S. ammonia production capacity was in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas because of their large reserves of natural gas, the dominant domestic feedstock for ammonia. In 2020, U.S. producers operated at about 85% of rated capacity. The United States was one of the worlds leading producers and consumers of ammonia. Urea, ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, ammonium phosphates, and ammonium sulfate were, in descending order of importance, the major derivatives of ammonia produced in the United States. Approximately 88% of apparent domestic ammonia consumption was for fertilizer use, including anhydrous ammonia for direct application, urea, ammonium nitrates, ammonium phosphates, and other nitrogen compounds. Ammonia also was used to produce explosives, plastics, synthetic fibers and resins, and numerous other chemical compounds.",None.,"The Henry Hub spot natural gas price ranged between $1.34 and $2.52 per million British thermal units for most of the year, with an average of about $2.07 per million British thermal units. Natural gas prices in 2020 were lower than those in 2019a result of mild weather that decreased demand for natural gas for heating in early 2020 and reduced manufacturing activity. The U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, projected that Henry Hub natural gas spot prices would average higher than $3.00 per million British thermal units in 2021. The weekly average gulf coast ammonia price was $220 per short ton at the beginning of 2020, decreased to $205 per short ton in mid-June, and then increased to $228 per short ton in early October. The average ammonia price for 2020 was estimated to be $220 per short ton. In 2020, low natural gas prices resulted in lower ammonia prices. A long period of stable and low natural gas prices in the United States has made it economical for companies to upgrade existing ammonia plants and construct new nitrogen facilities. The additional capacity has reduced ammonia imports. Expansion in the ammonia industry took place throughout the past 5 years; however, no additional ammonia plants are expected to be commissioned before 2022.Global ammonia capacity is expected to increase by a total of 4% during the next 4 years. Capacity additions are expected in Africa and south Asia; however, ongoing plant closures will decrease capacity in east Asia and Latin America. Demand for ammonia is expected to increase in all regions with the largest increases expected in Africa, central Asia, and Eastern Europe. Large corn plantings maintain the continued demand for nitrogen fertilizers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. corn growers planted 37.2 million hectares of corn in the 2020 crop-year (July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020), which was 3% greater than the area planted in crop-year 2019. Corn acreage in the 2021 crop-year is expected to increase because of anticipated higher returns for corn compared with those of other crops. In 2020, the fertilizer industry was considered part of the critical chemical sector by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders issued in March 2020 did not affect the fertilizer industry, and U.S. ammonia plants maintained full operations.","The availability of nitrogen from the atmosphere for fixed nitrogen production is unlimited. Mineralized occurrences of sodium and potassium nitrates, such as those found in the Atacama Desert of Chile, contribute minimally to the global nitrogen supply.",Nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient that has no substitute. No practical substitutes for nitrogen explosives and blasting agents are known.
