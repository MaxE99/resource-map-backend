MT,,2018,2019,2019.0,"'In 2019, no marketable antimony was mined in the United States. A mine in Nevada that had extracted about 800 tons of stibnite ore from 2013 through 2014 was placed on care-and-maintenance status in 2015 and had no reported production in 2019. Primary antimony metal and oxide were produced by one company in Montana using imported feedstock. Secondary antimony production was derived mostly from antimonial lead recovered from spent lead-acid batteries. The estimated value of secondary antimony produced in 2019, based on the average New York dealer price for antimony, was about $34 million. Recycling supplied about 14% of estimated domestic consumption, and the remainder came mostly from imports. The value of antimony consumption in 2019, based on the average New York dealer price, was about $234 million. The estimated distribution of domestic primary antimony consumption was as follows: nonmetal products, including ceramics and glass and rubber products, 22%; flame retardants, 40%; and metal products, including antimonial lead and ammunition, 39%.'","'The bulk of secondary antimony is recovered at secondary lead smelters as antimonial lead, most of which was generated by, and then consumed by, the lead-acid battery industry.'","'One company operated a smelter in Montana that produced antimony metal and oxides from imported intermediate products (antimony oxide and sodium antimonate) primarily from a smelter in Mexico that processed concentrates from mines in Australia and Mexico. China continued to be the leading global antimony producer in 2019 and accounted for more than 60% of global mine production. Beginning in 2018, many large-scale producers reduced production, and many small-scale producers were put on care-and-maintenance status in response to stricter environmental standards from Provincial and National Governments. In 2019, producers in Guizhou, Hunan, and Yunnan Provinces maintained a steady production rate after their smelters completed upgrades to meet the environmental standards. However, it was reported some mines had begun stockpiling concentrates, which lead to the suspension of operations at several smelters in Lengshuijiang area, Hunan Province, in August 2019. In September 2019, one of Chinas largest mining and metal-producing state-owned companies was the only bidder on the inventory of 18,600 tons of antimony and rare earths from the defunct Fanya Metal Exchange. '","'U.S. resources of antimony are mainly in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada. Principal identified world resources are in Australia, Bolivia, China, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Tajikistan. Additional antimony resources may occur in Mississippi Valley-type lead deposits in the Eastern United States.'","'Selected organic compounds and hydrated aluminum oxide are substitutes as flame retardants. Chromium, tin, titanium, zinc, and zirconium compounds substitute for antimony chemicals in enamels, paint, and pigments. Combinations of calcium, copper, selenium, sulfur, and tin are substitutes for alloys in lead-acid batteries.'"
