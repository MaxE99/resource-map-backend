MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'In 2021, the only domestic selenium-producing copper refinery halted production of refined selenium but produced selenium-bearing anode slime. The two other electrolytic copper refineries, operating in Arizona and Utah, did not recover selenium domestically, but did produce selenium-bearing anode slimes. U.S. selenium production in prior years and consumption and stock data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Estimates for end uses in global consumption were, in descending order, metallurgy (including manganese production), glass manufacturing, agriculture, chemicals and pigments, electronics, and other uses. Selenium is used in blasting caps to control delays; in catalysts to enhance selective oxidation; in copper, lead, and steel alloys to improve machinability; in the electrolytic production of manganese to increase yields; in glass manufacturing to decolorize the green tint caused by iron impurities in container glass and other soda-lime silica glass; in gun bluing to improve cosmetic appearance and provide corrosion resistance; in plating solutions to improve appearance and durability; in rubber compounding chemicals to act as a vulcanizing agent; and in thin-film photovoltaic copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) solar cells. Selenium is an essential micronutrient and is used as a human dietary supplement, a dietary supplement for livestock, and as a fertilizer additive to enrich selenium-poor soils. Selenium is also used as an active ingredient in antidandruff shampoos.'",'Domestic production of secondary selenium was estimated to be very small because most scrap from older plain paper photocopiers and electronic materials was exported for recovery of the contained selenium.',"'The supply of selenium is directly affected by the supply of the materials from which it is a byproductcopper and, to a lesser extent, nickeland it is directly affected by the number of facilities that recover selenium. The estimated annual average price for selenium was $8.00 per pound in 2021, a 21% increase from that in 2020. Average weekly prices have risen steadily from the beginning of 2021. Copper producers in China had opted to stop sales from their inventories, reducing availability of selenium. Selenium prices increased owing to a rise in crude selenium feedstock costs. In China, selenium suppliers and consumers both experienced difficulties acquiring adequate materials. Electrolytic manganese production was the main metallurgical end use for selenium in China, where selenium dioxide was used in the electrolytic process to increase current efficiency and the metal deposition rate. Manganese production decreased in 2021, owing to output reductions by major manganese producers in China. The reductions were put in place to reduce spot availability and raise prices. The manganese industry alliance had a commitment to shut down operations for 30 days every 4 months, with a total of 90 days in 2021. '","' Reserves for selenium are based on identified copper deposits and average selenium content. Coal generally contains between 0.5 and 12 parts per million selenium, or about 80 to 90 times the average for copper deposits. The recovery of selenium from coal fly ash, although technically feasible, does not appear likely to be economical in the foreseeable future.'","'Silicon is the major substitute for selenium in low- and medium-voltage rectifiers. Organic pigments have been developed as substitutes for cadmium sulfoselenide pigments. Other substitutes include cerium oxide as either a colorant or decolorant in glass; tellurium in pigments and rubber; bismuth, lead, and tellurium in free- machining alloys; and bismuth and tellurium in lead-free brasses. Sulfur dioxide can be used as a replacement for selenium dioxide in the production of electrolytic manganese metal, but it is not as energy efficient. The selenium-tellurium photoreceptors used in some plain paper copiers and laser printers have been replaced by organic photoreceptors in newer machines. Amorphous silicon and cadmium telluride are the two principal competitors with CIGS in thin-film photovoltaic solar cells.'"
