The U.S. soda ash industry comprised four companies in Wyoming operating five plants and one company in California operating one plant. The five producing companies have a combined annual nameplate capacity of 13.9 million tons (15.3 million short tons). Borax, salt, and sodium sulfate were produced as coproducts of sodium carbonate production in California. Chemical caustic soda, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium sulfite were manufactured as coproducts at several of the Wyoming soda ash plants. Sodium bicarbonate was produced at an operation in Colorado using soda ash feedstock shipped from the companys Wyoming facility. Based on 2021 quarterly reports, the estimated distribution of soda ash by end use was glass, 49%; chemicals, 28%; miscellaneous uses, 8%; distributors, 5%; soap and detergents, 5%; flue gas desulfurization, 3%; pulp and paper, 1%; and water treatment, 1%.","No soda ash was recycled by producers; however, glass container producers use cullet glass, thereby reducing soda ash consumption.","Production, exports, and consumption in 2021 nearly returned to levels seen before the global COVID-19 pandemic. More than one-half of U.S. production of soda ash was exported, and exports were estimated to have increased by 16% compared with those in 2020. Domestic consumption reported by producers increased by about 19% in 2021 compared with that in 2020, and apparent consumption in 2021 increased by about 21% compared with that in 2020.Relatively low production costs and lower environmental impacts provide natural soda ash producers some advantage over producers of synthetic soda ash. The production of synthetic soda ash normally consumes more energy and releases more carbon dioxide than that of natural soda ash. In recent years, U.S. producers of natural soda ash were able to expand their markets when several synthetic soda ash plants were closed or idled in other parts of the world. After increasing capacity during the past 4 years, total production capacity in Turkey was estimated to be between 4 million and 5 million tons per year, and soda ash shipments in Turkey, especially for export, were expected to increase during the next few years. Total United States imports, mostly from Turkey, have recently been about 100,000 tons per year, which was more than double the average quantity of annual imports during the past decade.","Natural soda ash is obtained from trona and sodium carbonate-rich brines. The worlds largest deposit of trona is in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. About 47 billion tons of identified soda ash resources could be recovered from the 56 billion tons of bedded trona and the 47 billion tons of interbedded or intermixed trona and halite, which are in beds more than 1.2 meters thick. Underground room-and-pillar mining, using conventional and continuous mining, is the primary method of mining Wyoming trona ore. This method has an average 45% mining recovery, whereas average recovery from solution mining is 30%. Improved solution-mining techniques, such as horizontal drilling to establish communication between well pairs, could increase this extraction rate and enable companies to develop some of the deeper trona beds. Wyoming trona resources are being depleted at the rate of about 15 million tons per year (8.3 million tons of soda ash). Searles Lake and Owens Lake in California contain an estimated 815 million tons of soda ash reserves. At least 95 natural sodium carbonate deposits have been identified in the world, the resources of only some of which have been quantified. Although soda ash can be manufactured from salt and limestone, both of which are practically inexhaustible, synthetic soda ash is costlier to produce and generates environmental wastes.","Caustic soda can be substituted for soda ash in certain uses, particularly in the pulp and paper, water treatment, and certain chemical sectors. Soda ash, soda liquors, or trona can be used as feedstock to manufacture chemical caustic soda, which is an alternative to electrolytic caustic soda."
