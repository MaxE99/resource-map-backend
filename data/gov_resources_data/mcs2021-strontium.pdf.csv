MT,,2019,2020,"Although deposits of strontium minerals occur widely throughout the United States, none have been mined in the United States since 1959. Domestic production of strontium carbonate, the principal strontium compound, ceased in 2006. Virtually all the strontium mineral celestite consumed in the United States since 2006 is thought to have been used as an additive in drilling fluids for oil and natural gas wells. A few domestic companies produced small quantities of downstream strontium chemicals from imported strontium carbonate. Based on import data, the estimated end-use distribution in the United States for strontium, including celestite and strontium compounds, was, in descending order, ceramic ferrite magnets and pyrotechnics and signals, 27% each; drilling fluids, 26%; and electrolytic production of zinc, master alloys, pigments and fillers, and other applications, including glass, 5% each.",None.,"Apparent consumption of strontium declined by 63% in 2020 compared with that in 2019 because of the economic downturn caused by restrictions imposed worldwide as the result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries experienced significant industrial declines, and celestite production was estimated to have declined from most sources. Imports of celestite, the most commonly used strontium mineral, decreased by 84%, likely the result of decreased natural-gas- and oil-drilling activity, which was at least partly caused by the pandemic restrictions. Nearly all celestite imports were from Mexico and were thought to be used as additives in drilling fluids for oil and natural gas exploration and production, which experienced declined activity. For these applications, celestite is ground but undergoes no chemical processing. A small quantity of high-value celestite imports were reported; these were most likely mineral specimens. Although no strontium carbonate was produced in the United States, celestite is the raw material from which strontium carbonate and other strontium compounds are produced. Strontium carbonate is the most commonly traded strontium compound and is used as the raw material from which other strontium compounds are derived. Strontium carbonate is sintered with iron oxide to produce permanent ceramic ferrite magnets, and strontium nitrate contributes a brilliant red color to fireworks and signal flares. Smaller quantities of these and other strontium compounds were consumed in several other applications, including electrolytic production of zinc, glass production, master alloys, and pigments and fillers. Imports of strontium compounds decreased by 32% in 2020.",World resources of strontium are thought to exceed 1 billion tons.,"Barium can be substituted for strontium in ferrite ceramic magnets; however, the resulting barium composite will have reduced maximum operating temperature when compared with that of strontium composites. Substituting for strontium in pyrotechnics is hindered by difficulty in obtaining the desired brilliance and visibility imparted by strontium and its compounds. In drilling mud, barite is the preferred material, but celestite may substitute for some barite, especially when barite prices are high."
