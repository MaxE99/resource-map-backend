MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'U.S. mine production of molybdenum in 2020 increased by 13% to 49,000 tons compared with the previous year. Molybdenum ore was produced as a primary product at two minesboth in Coloradowhereas seven copper mines (four in Arizona and one each in Montana, Nevada, and Utah) recovered molybdenite concentrate as a byproduct. Three roasting plants converted molybdenite concentrate to molybdic oxide, from which intermediate products, such as ferromolybdenum, metal powder, and various chemicals, were produced. Metallurgical applications accounted for more than 88% of the total molybdenum consumed.'","'Molybdenum is recycled as a component of catalysts, ferrous scrap, and superalloy scrap. Ferrous scrap consists of revert, new, and old scrap. Revert scrap refers to remnants manufactured in the steelmaking process. New scrap is generated by steel mill customers and recycled by scrap collectors and processors. Old scrap is largely molybdenum-bearing alloys recycled after serving their useful life. The amount of molybdenum recycled as part of new and old steel and other scrap may be as much as 30% of the apparent supply of molybdenum. There are no processes for the separate recovery and refining of secondary molybdenum from its alloys. Molybdenum is not recovered separately from recycled steel and superalloys, but the molybdenum content of the recycled alloys is significant, and the molybdenum content is reused. Recycling of molypdenum-bearing scrap will continue to be dependent on the markets for the principal alloy metals in which molybdenum is contained, such as iron, nickel, and chromium.'","'In 2020, the estimated average molybdic oxide price decreased by 25% compared with that of 2019, and U.S. estimated mine output of molybdenum increased by 13% from that of 2019. The increase in production was mainly the result of one byproduct mine in Utah increasing its production by more than 60%. This increase in production in Utah offset the production delays caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic at other molybdenum producers. Byproduct molybdenum production continued at the Bagdad, Morenci, Pinto Valley, and Sierrita Mines in Arizona; the Continental Pit Mine in Montana; the Robinson Mine in Nevada; and the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah. Primary molybdenum production continued at the Climax and Henderson Mines in Colorado. The Thompson Creek Mine in Idaho continued to be on care-and-maintenance status in 2020. Estimated U.S. imports for consumption decreased by 24% compared with those of 2019. U.S. exports decreased by 8% from those of 2019. Apparent consumption increased by 26% compared with that of 2019. Global molybdenum production in 2020 increased slightly compared with 2019. In descending order of production, China, Chile, the United States, Peru, and Mexico provided more than 90% of total global production.'","'dentified resources of molybdenum in the United States are about 5.4 million tons, and in the rest of the world, about 20 million tons. Molybdenum occurs as the principal metal sulfide in large low-grade porphyry molybdenum deposits and as an associated metal sulfide in low-grade porphyry copper deposits. Resources of molybdenum are adequate to supply world needs for the foreseeable future.'","'There is little substitution for molybdenum in its major application in steels and cast irons. In fact, because of the availability and versatility of molybdenum, industry has sought to develop new materials that benefit from its alloying properties. Potential substitutes include boron, chromium, niobium (columbium), and vanadium in alloy steels; tungsten in tool steels; graphite, tantalum, and tungsten for refractory materials in high-temperature electric furnaces; and cadmium-red, chrome-orange, and organic-orange pigments for molybdenum orange.'"
