One company sold fluorspar from stockpiles produced as a byproduct of its limestone quarrying operation in Cave-in-Rock, IL, and continued development of its fluorspar mine in Kentucky. In May, a second company, in Utah, began site preparations for the construction of a plant to produce metallurgical-grade fluorspar briquets. An estimated 22,000 tons of fluorosilicic acid (FSA), equivalent to about 36,000 tons of fluorspar grading 100% CaF2, was recovered from three phosphoric acid plants processing phosphate rock and was primarily used in water fluoridation. A company in Aurora, NC, continued construction on a plant to produce hydrofluoric acid (HF) from FSA which was expected to begin operation in 2022. The U.S. Department of Energy continued to produce aqueous HF as a byproduct of the conversion of depleted uranium hexafluoride to depleted uranium oxide at plants in Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH. U.S. fluorspar consumption was satisfied by imports. Domestically, production of HF in Louisiana and Texas was by far the leading use for acid-grade fluorspar. Hydrofluoric acid is the primary feedstock for the manufacture of virtually all fluorine-bearing chemicals, particularly refrigerants and fluoropolymers, and is also a key ingredient in the processing of aluminum and uranium. Fluorspar was also used in cement production, in enamels, as a flux in steelmaking, in glass manufacture, in iron and steel casting, and in welding rod coatings. '","'Synthetic fluorspar may be produced from neutralization of waste in the enrichment of uranium, petroleum alkylation, and stainless-steel pickling; however, undesirable impurities constrain use. Primary aluminum producers recycle HF and fluorides from smelting operations.'","'Global mine production was estimated to have increased in 2021 primarily owing to the continued rampup of production at mines in Canada, Mongolia, and South Africa. Globally, several projects to produce HF from FSA also continued to progress. Some countries continued to phase down production, consumption, and imports of non-feedstock hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used as aerosols, propellants, and refrigerants owing to HFCs high global warming potential. Consumption of fluorspar in Europe decreased since the European Unions fluorinated greenhouse gas (also known as F-Gas) regulation went into effect in 2015 and several producers discontinued production of HFCs. Subsequent price increases and lack of availability have reportedly led to a resurgence in illegal imports and sales of these materials. Previous phasedowns of chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons led to similar activity. In response to the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, in October, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Allowance Allocation and Trading Program as part of its final rule to phase down the production and consumption of non-feedstock HFCs by 85% over the next 15 years. The rule set baseline production and consumption levels from which reductions will be made and established a methodology for allocating and trading HFC allowances. In a related action, the White House established an interagency task force on illegal HFC trade. The State Intellectual Property Office of China invalidated a U.S. companys patent on a manufacturing process used to produce hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). HFOs have increasingly been adopted as low-global-warming-potential alternatives to HFCs.'","'Large quantities of fluorine are present in phosphate rock. Current U.S. reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 1 billion tons, containing about 72 million tons of 100% fluorspar equivalent assuming an average fluorine content of 3.5% in the phosphate rock. World reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be'","'FSA is used to produce aluminum fluoride (AIFs) and HF. Because of differing physical properties, AIF 3 produced from FSA is not readily substituted for AIFs produced from fluorspar. Aluminum smelting dross, borax, calcium chloride, iron oxides, manganese ore, silica sand, and titanium dioxide have been used as substitutes for fluorspar fluxes.'"
