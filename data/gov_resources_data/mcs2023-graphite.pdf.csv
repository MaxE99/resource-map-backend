MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"In 2022, natural graphite was not produced in the United States; however, approximately 95 U.S. companies, primarily in the Great Lakes and Northeast regions, consumed 72,000 tons valued at an estimated $140 million. The major uses of natural graphite were batteries, brake linings, lubricants, powdered metals, refractory applications, and steelmaking. During 2022, U.S. natural graphite imports were an estimated 82,000 tons, consisting of about 77% flake and high-purity, 22% amorphous, and 1% lump and chip graphite. Graphite consumption is expected to continue to increase, owing largely to growth from the electric-vehicle market. The battery end-use market for graphite has grown by 250% globally since 2018. In the United States, 4 lithium-ion battery manufacturing plants are currently in operation, with an additional 21 in development. At full capacity, these plants are expected to require approximately 1.2 million tons per year of spherical purified graphite, with an estimated 40% to 60% coming from synthetic graphite.","Refractory brick and linings, alumina-graphite refractories for continuous metal castings, magnesia- graphite refractory brick for basic oxygen and electric arc furnaces, and insulation brick led the way in the recycling of graphite products. Recycling of refractory graphite material is increasing, with material being recycled into products such as brake linings and thermal insulation. Recovering high-quality flake graphite from steelmaking kish is technically feasible, but currently not practiced. The abundance of graphite in the world market inhibits increased recycling efforts. Information on the quantity and value of recycled graphite is not available.","U.S. natural graphite imports decreased by 29% and 28% in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and then increased by 48% in 2021, and by 55% in 2022. U.S. imports for consumption and U.S. apparent consumption increased by 16% and 19%, respectively, for the 5-year period of 2018 to 2022. The increase in consumption is likely due to rising demand from the lithium-ion battery industry. In 2022, China was the worlds leading graphite producer, producing an estimated 65% of total world production. Approximately 24% of graphite produced in China was amorphous and about 76% was flake. China produced some large flake graphite, but much of its flake graphite production was very small, in the +200-mesh range. China also processed most of the worlds spherical graphite.North America produced only 1.2% of the worlds graphite supply with production in Canada and Mexico. Three companies were developing graphite-mining projects in the United Statestwo in Alabama and one in Alaska. Two spherical graphite plants were in construction during 2022, located in Kellyton, AL, and Vidalia, LA, with production expected to begin during 2023. In 2022, the Vidalia project was awarded a grant of up to $220 million under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law towards expanding the production capacity to 45,000 tons per year. Africa has been a recent focus for graphite exploration, with projects under development in Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, and Tanzania. Additional projects were in advanced development stages in Australia, Canada, and Sweden. A Canadian company and an Australian company continued to construct mines in Madagascar and Tanzania, respectively, with production expected to begin by 2023. In 2022, an Australian company commissioned a graphite anode plant in Sweden, becoming the first commercial plant operating in Europe. In February, Ukraine halted graphite production, citing Russian military action. Operations recommenced in August, although future production was uncertain as the conflict continued. Additionally, the United States and many other countries have suspended normal trade relations with Russia, removing supplies of Russian graphite from much of the global market. Leading up to the conflict, Ukraine and Russia were considered among the top 10 producers of graphite.","Domestic resources of graphite are relatively small, but the rest of the worlds resources exceed 800 million tons of recoverable graphite.","Synthetic graphite powder, scrap from discarded machined shapes, and calcined petroleum coke compete for use in iron and steel production. Synthetic graphite powder and secondary synthetic graphite from machining graphite shapes compete for use in battery applications. Finely ground coke with olivine is a potential competitor in foundry-facing applications. Molybdenum disulfide competes as a dry lubricant but is more sensitive to oxidizing conditions."
