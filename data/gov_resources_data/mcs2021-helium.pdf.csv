MCM,,2019.0,2020.0,2020,"'The estimated value of Grade-A helium (99.997% or greater) extracted during 2020 by private industry was about $322 million. Fourteen plants (one in Arizona, two in Colorado, five in Kansas, one in Oklahoma, four in Texas, and one in Utah) extracted helium from natural gas and produced crude helium that ranged from 50% to 99% helium. One plant in Colorado and another in Wyoming extracted helium from natural gas and produced Grade-A helium. Three plants in Kansas and one in Oklahoma accepted crude helium from other producers and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) pipeline and purified it to Grade-A helium. In 2020, estimated domestic apparent consumption of Grade-A helium was 40 million cubic meters (1.4 billion cubic feet), and it was used for magnetic resonance imaging, lifting gas, analytical and laboratory applications, welding, engineering and scientific applications, leak detection and semiconductor manufacturing, and various other minor applications.'","'In the United States, helium used in large-volume applications is seldom recycled. Some low-volume or liquid boil-off recovery systems are used. In the rest of the world, helium recycling is practiced more often.'","'Helium production in 2020 decreased in the United States and worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, the BLM announced plans for disposal of the remaining Federal helium inventory and assets by September 2021, after which the General Services Administration would complete the disposal process. Federal in-kind users would continue to have access to helium until September 30, 2022. In Russia, a company was building a 60-million-cubic-meter-per-year helium processing plant that was expected to be completed by late 2024.'","'Section 16 of Public Law 113-40 requires the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to complete a national helium gas assessment. The USGS and the BLM coordinated efforts to complete this assessment. The USGS results are expected to be published in 2021. The BLM plans to publish an update to its report of the Helium Resources of the United States by midyear 2021. Until then, the following estimates are still the best available. As of December 31, 2006, the total helium reserves and resources of the United States were estimated to be 20.6 billion cubic meters (744 billion cubic feet). This includes 4.25 billion cubic meters (153 billion cubic feet) of measured reserves, 5.33 billion cubic meters (192 billion cubic feet) of probable resources, 5.93 billion cubic meters (214 billion cubic feet) of possible resources, and 5.11 billion cubic meters (184 billion cubic feet) of speculative resources. Measured reserves include 670 million cubic meters (24.2 billion cubic feet) of helium stored in the Cliffside Field Government Reserve and 65 million cubic meters (2.3 billion cubic feet) of helium contained in Cliffside Field native gas. The Cliffside (Texas), Hugoton (Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas), Panhandle West (Texas), Panoma (Kansas), and Riley Ridge (Wyoming) Fields are the depleting fields from which most U.S.-produced helium is extracted. These fields contained an estimated 3.9 billion cubic meters (140 billion cubic feet) of helium. Helium resources of the world, exclusive of the United States, were estimated to be about 31.3 billion cubic meters (1.13 trillion cubic feet). The locations and volumes of the major deposits, in billion cubic meters, are Qatar, 10.1; Algeria, 8.2; Russia, 6.8; Canada, 2.0; and China, 1.1. As of December 31, 2020, the BLM had analyzed about 22,700 gas samples from 26 countries and the United States, in a program to identify world helium resources.'","'There is no substitute for helium in cryogenic applications if temperatures below 429 F are required. Argon can be substituted for helium in welding, and hydrogen can be substituted for helium in some lighter-than-air applications in which the flammable nature of hydrogen is not objectionable. Hydrogen is also being investigated as a substitute for helium in deep-sea diving applications below 305 meters (1,000 feet).'"
