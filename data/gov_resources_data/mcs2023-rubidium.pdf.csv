MT,"In 2022, no rubidium was mined in the United States; however, occurrences of rubidium-bearing minerals are known in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, South Dakota, and Utah. Rubidium is also associated with some evaporate mineral occurrences in other States. Rubidium is not a major constituent of any mineral. Rubidium concentrate is produced as a byproduct of pollucite (cesium) and lepidolite (lithium) mining and is imported from other countries for processing in the United States. Applications for rubidium and its compounds include biomedical research, electronics, pyrotechnics, and specialty glass. Specialty glasses are the leading market for rubidium; rubidium carbonate may be used to reduce electrical conductivity, which improves stability and durability in fiber-optic telecommunications networks. Biomedical applications may include rubidium salts used in antishock agents and the treatment of epilepsy and thyroid disorder; rubidium-82, a radioactive isotope may be used as a blood-flow tracer in positron emission tomographic imaging; and rubidium chloride may be used as an antidepressant. Rubidium atoms are used in academic research, including the development of quantum-mechanics-based computing devices, a future application with potential for relatively high consumption of rubidium. Quantum computing research uses ultracold rubidium atoms in a variety of applications. Quantum computers, which have the ability to perform more complex computational tasks than traditional computers by calculating in two quantum states simultaneously, were under development with potential for entering the experimental phase by 2025. Rubidiums photoemissive properties make it useful for electrical-signal generators in motion-sensor devices, night- vision devices, photoelectric cells (solar panels), and photomultiplier tubes. Rubidium may be used as an atomic resonance-frequency-reference oscillator for telecommunications network synchronization, playing a vital role in global positioning systems. Rubidium-rich feldspars may be used in ceramic applications for spark plugs and electrical insulators because of their high dielectric constant. Rubidium hydroxide may be used in fireworks to oxidize mixtures of other elements and produce violet hues. The U.S. military frequency standard, the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) timescale, is based on 48 weighted atomic clocks, including 4 USNO rubidium fountain clocks.",None.,"Domestic rubidium occurrences will remain subeconomic unless market conditions change, such as the development of new end uses or increased consumption for existing end uses, which in turn could lead to increased prices. No known human health issues are associated with exposure to naturally occurring rubidium, and its use has minimal environmental impact. During 2022, no rubidium production was reported globally but rubidium was thought to have been produced in China. Production of rubidium from all countries, excluding China, ceased within the past two decades. Mining of rubidium in Namibia ceased in the early 2000s. from Pollucite mining at the Tanco Mine in Canada (with the potential extraction of byproduct rubidium) ended in 2015. The Bikita Mine in Zimbabwe was depleted of pollucite ore reserves in 2018. The Sinclair Mine in Australia completed the mining and shipments of all economically recoverable pollucite ore in 2019. Recent reports indicate that with current processing rates, the worlds commercial stockpiles of rubidium ore, excluding those in China, may be depleted in the near future. Throughout 2022, multiple projects that could produce rubidium as a byproduct of lepidolite, pollucite, spodumene, or zinnwaldite mining, focused primarily on lithium or cesium extraction, were in the exploration and feasibility stages, and one company was working on mine development. Beginning in late 2021 and early 2022, pollucite ore from the Tanco Mine was being shipped to China for lithium recovery.","Significant rubidium-bearing pegmatite occurrences have been identified in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Peru, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zambia. Minor quantities of rubidium are reported in brines in northern Chile and China and in evaporites in the United States (New Mexico and Utah), France, and Germany.","Rubidium and cesium can be used interchangeably in many applications because they have similar physical properties and atomic radii. Cesium, however, is more electropositive than rubidium, making it a preferred material for some applications."
