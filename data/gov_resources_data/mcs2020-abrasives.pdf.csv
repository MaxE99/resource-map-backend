MT,,2018,2019,2018,2019,"'Fused aluminum oxide was produced by two companies at three plants in the United States and Canada. Production of crude fused aluminum oxide had an estimated value of $7 million. Silicon carbide was produced by two companies at two plants in the United States. Production of crude silicon carbide had an estimated value of about $26 million. Metallic abrasives were produced by 11 companies in 8 States. Production of metallic abrasives had an estimated value of about $190 million. Bonded and coated abrasive products accounted for most abrasive uses of fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide. Metallic abrasives are used primarily for steel shot and grit and cut wire shot, which are used for sandblasting, peening, and stonecutting applications.'","'Up to 30% of fused aluminum oxide may be recycled, and about 5% of silicon carbide is recycled.'","'In 2019, China was the worlds leading producer of abrasive fused aluminum oxide and abrasive silicon carbide. Imports, especially from China where operating costs were lower, continued to challenge abrasives producers in the United States and Canada. In recent years, imports of abrasives from Hong Kong have also increased. Foreign competition is expected to persist and continue to limit production in North America. The average unit value of imports has increased every year since 2016 for regular fused aluminum oxide and crude silicon carbide. The average unit values of imports of regular fused aluminum oxide and crude silicon carbide during the first 6 months of 2019 were 5% and 20% higher, respectively, than those in 2018 and 49% and 60% higher, respectively, than those in 2017. Abrasives consumption in the United States is greatly influenced by activity in the manufacturing sectors, in particular the aerospace, automotive, furniture, housing, and steel industries. Steel grit can be reclaimed and used multiple times. The use of reclaimed metallic abrasives increased potentially owing to rising surcharges on scrap and waste disposal and increasing prices for new material. One of the leading abrasives producers in the world divested its silicon carbide business to a private equity firm during 2019. '","'Although domestic resources of raw materials for the production of fused aluminum oxide are rather limited, adequate resources are available in the Western Hemisphere. Domestic resources are more than adequate for the production of silicon carbide.'","'Natural and manufactured abrasives, such as garnet, emery, or metallic abrasives, can be substituted for fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide in various applications.'"
