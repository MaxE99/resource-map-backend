MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'In January 2019, byproduct vanadium production resumed in Utah and an estimated 470 tons of contained vanadium with an estimated value of $6.8 million was produced. In 2009-13, small quantities of vanadium were similarly produced as a byproduct from the mining of uraniferous sandstones on the Colorado Plateau. Secondary vanadium production continued primarily in Arkansas, Delaware, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas, where processed waste materials (petroleum residues, spent catalysts, utility ash, and vanadium-bearing pig iron slag) were used to produce ferrovanadium, vanadium-bearing chemicals or specialty alloys, vanadium metal, and vanadium pentoxide. Metallurgical use, primarily as an alloying agent for iron and steel, accounted for about 94% of domestic reported vanadium consumption in 2019. Of the other uses for vanadium, the major nonmetallurgical use was in catalysts to produce maleic anhydride and sulfuric acid.'",'The quantity of vanadium recycled from spent chemical process catalysts was significant and may compose as much as 40% of total vanadium catalysts.',"'U.S. apparent consumption of vanadium in 2019 decreased by 18% from that of 2018. Among the major uses for vanadium, production of carbon, full-alloy, and high-strength low-alloy steels accounted for 18%, 45%, and 31%, respectively, of domestic consumption. Average 2019 vanadium pentoxide prices decreased by 28% compared with 2018 prices, and ferrovanadium prices decreased by 41% to $23 per pound in 2019 compared with 2018. In January 2019, ferrovanadium prices averaged $43.10 per pound but continued to decrease for the remainder of 2019. Byproduct vanadium production in the United States resumed in early 2019 at the White Mesa mill in Utah. The company expected to continue production, subject to successful recovery and suitable prices. An iron and vanadium mine in South Africa remained closed leaving South Africa with only two major producers of vanadium. A producer in Brazil that started production in 2014 began construction on an expansion project in 2018 that would increase its production capacity by 25%. The expansion was expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2019. The implementation of the new high-strength rebar standards by the Standardization Administration of China has been enforced more gradually than originally expected. Larger mills began implementation in 2018; however, smaller mills have been slower to implement the new standards. Enforcement of the new standards was also reportedly more difficult to monitor at smaller mills. The increase of vanadium in rebar was originally expected to increase overall consumption of vanadium in China by approximately 10,000 tons per year.'","'World resources of vanadium exceed 63 million tons. Vanadium occurs in deposits of phosphate rock, titaniferous magnetite, and uraniferous sandstone and siltstone, in which it constitutes less than 2% of the host'","'Steels containing various combinations of other alloying elements can be substituted for steels containing vanadium. Certain metals, such as manganese, molybdenum, niobium (columbium), titanium, and tungsten, are to some degree interchangeable with vanadium as alloying elements in steel. Platinum and nickel can replace vanadium compounds as catalysts in some chemical processes. Currently, no acceptable substitute for vanadium is available for use in aerospace titanium alloys.'"
