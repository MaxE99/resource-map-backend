MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'Significant U.S. tantalum mine production has not been reported since 1959. Domestic tantalum resources are of low grade, some are mineralogically complex, and most are not commercially recoverable. Companies in the United States produced tantalum alloys, capacitors, carbides, compounds, and tantalum metal from imported tantalum ores and concentrates and tantalum-containing materials. Tantalum metal and alloys were recovered from foreign and domestic scrap. Domestic tantalum consumption was not reported by consumers. Major end uses for tantalum included alloys for gas turbines used in the aerospace and oil and gas industries; tantalum capacitors for automotive electronics, mobile phones, and personal computers; tantalum carbides for cutting and boring tools; and tantalum oxide (TazOs) was used in glass lenses to make lighter weight camera lenses that produce a brighter image. The value of tantalum consumed in 2020 was estimated to exceed $210 million as measured by the value of imports.'","'Tantalum was recycled mostly from new scrap that was generated during the manufacture of tantalum- containing electronic components and from tantalum-containing cemented carbide and superalloy scrap. The amount of tantalum recycled was not available, but it may be as much as 30% of apparent consumption.'","'U.S. tantalum apparent consumption (measured in contained tantalum) was estimated to have decreased by 6% from that of 2019. Most of the tantalum imported was in the form of scrap followed by a slightly lesser quantity of metal and powder; imports of ores and concentrates decreased by almost 20% from that in 2019. Globally, consumption of tantalum decreased because of disruptions in transportation and electronics manufacturing supply chains caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic; a leading end use for tantalum was in capacitors. Significant production decreases by major aircraft manufacturers reduced tantalum consumption for superalloys. World production was lower in part because of temporary mine closures in Brazil and Rwanda caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued low prices for tantalum was also a factor. In Australia, lithium mines that had produced tantalum as a byproduct in 2019 remained on care-and-maintenance status in 2020 because of continued low prices for lithium. Production in Congo (Kinshasa) was estimated to have increased in 2020 based on reported ore production through August 2020; China was the main export destination. Brazil, Congo (Kinshasa), and Rwanda accounted for 77% of estimated global tantalum mine production in 2020. The U.S. Department of Defense issued an interim rule effective October 1, 2020, amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to implement a section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 that prohibits the acquisition of tantalum metal and alloys from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.'","'Identified world resources of tantalum, most of which are in Australia, Brazil, and Canada, are considered adequate to supply projected needs. The United States has about 55,000 tons of tantalum resources in identified deposits, most of which were considered uneconomical at 2020 prices for tantalum.'","'The following materials can be substituted for tantalum, but a performance loss or higher costs may ensue: niobium and tungsten in carbides; aluminum, ceramics, and niobium in electronic capacitors; glass, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, platinum, stainless steel, titanium, and zirconium in corrosion-resistant applications; and hafnium, iridium, molybdenum, niobium, rhenium, and tungsten in high-temperature applications.'"
