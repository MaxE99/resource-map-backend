1000 MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,2021,2022,"'Production of clays (sold or used) in the United States was estimated to be 26 million tons valued at $1.7 billion in 2022, with about 120 companies operating clay and shale mines in 38 States. The leading 20 companies produced approximately 69% of the U.S. tonnage and 83% of the value for all types of clay. Principal domestic uses for specific clays were estimated to be as follows: ball clay52% floor and wall tile and 19% sanitaryware; bentonite49% pet waste absorbents and 23% drilling mud; common clay46% brick, 26% lightweight aggregate, and 23% cement; fullers earth83% absorbents (including oil and grease absorbents, pet waste absorbents, and miscellaneous absorbents); and kaolin52% fillers, extenders, and binders and 25% ceramics. Fire clay uses were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Exports of clay and shale were estimated to have decreased by 4% in 2022 from those in 2021 after increasing by 18% in 2021 from exports in 2020. In 2022, the United States exported an estimated 890,000 tons of bentonite; Canada, Japan, and Mexico, in decreasing order, were the leading destinations. About 2.1 million tons of kaolin was exported mainly as a paper coating and filler; a component in ceramic bodies; and fillers and extenders in paint, plastic, and rubber products; Mexico, China, and Japan, in decreasing order, were the leading destinations. Lesser quantities of ball clay, fire clay, and fullers earth were exported for ceramic, refractory, and absorbent uses, respectively.'",'Insignificant.',"'In March 2022, a Georgia kaolin producer completed the sale of certain North American assets and mining resources that support the paper and packaging markets to another kaolin producer with headquarters in Georgia. Additionally, another kaolin producer with North American headquarters in Georgia completed an acquisition in September 2022, which included four production sites and related mines, reserves, and two processing facilities in central Georgia.'",'Resources of all clays are extremely large.',"'Clays compete with calcium carbonate in filler and extender applications; diatomite, organic pet litters, polymers, silica gel, and zeolites as absorbents; and various siding and roofing types in building construction.'"
