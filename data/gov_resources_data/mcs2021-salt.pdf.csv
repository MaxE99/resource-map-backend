1000 MT,,2019,2020,"'Domestic production of salt was estimated to have decreased by 7% in 2020 to 39 million tons. The total value of salt sold or used was estimated to be about $2.4 billion. Twenty-six companies operated 63 plants in 16 States. The top producing States were, in alphabetical order, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Utah. These seven States produced about 95% of the salt in the United States in 2020. The estimated percentage of salt sold or used was, by type, rock salt, 43%; salt in brine, 40%; vacuum pan salt, 10%; and solar salt, 7%. Highway deicing accounted for about 43% of total salt consumed. The chemical industry accounted for about 38% of total salt sales, with salt in brine accounting for 90% of the salt used for chemical feedstock. Chlorine and caustic soda manufacturers were the main consumers within the chemical industry. The remaining markets for salt were distributors, 9%; food processing, 4%; agricultural, 2%; and general industrial and primary water treatment, 1% each. The remaining 2% was other uses combined with exports.'",'None.',"'The global COVID-19 pandemic affected production and consumption of salt throughout the world in 2020. The most significant impact was felt in the chloroalkali industry because international trade declined, but the entire salt sector was negatively affected to varying degrees. The chloralkali industry was also disrupted by severe weather events, mainly hurricanes, in the primary production areas of Louisiana and Texas. The 201920 winter was slightly milder than average after several years of average or below average winter temperatures and more winter weather events than usual. The number of winter weather events including freezing rain, sleet, and snow is a better predictor of demand for rock salt than total snow fall. Several low snowfall or icing events will usually require more salt for highway deicing than a single large snowfall event. Rock salt production and imports in 2020 decreased compared with those of 2019 because demand from many local and State transportation departments decreased. Most local and State governments in regions that experienced a less intense winter season reportedly had remaining stockpiles and therefore less need to replenish supplies of rock salt for the winter of 202021. For the winter of 202021, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a moderate to strong La Nia weather pattern. A strong La Nia historically favors an average to warmer temperature pattern, but a moderate La Nia favors a colder winter. Based on several factors, the forecasts slightly favored a wetter than normal winter. A warmer and drier pattern was predicted for the southern areas of the United States, but the northwestern and northern plains were more likely to have below average temperatures and elevated precipitation. Areas from the mid-Atlantic to New England were thought to have a better than average chance for warmer temperatures and average precipitation. These forecasts would indicate that demand for rock salt could increase in the Midwest and decrease in the northeastern United States from Maine through Virginia. Demand for salt brine used in the chloralkali industry was expected to rebound in 2021 as demand for caustic soda increases globally, especially in Asia. Exports from Australia and especially India increased to meet the increasing demand for caustic soda in China, but tensions between China and both countries could affect trade. '","'* World continental resources of salt are vast, and the salt content in the oceans is nearly unlimited. Domestic resources of rock salt and salt from brine are primarily in Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Texas. Saline lakes and solar evaporation salt facilities are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah. Almost every country in the world has salt deposits or solar evaporation operations of various sizes.'","'No economic substitutes or alternatives for salt exist in most applications. Calcium chloride and calcium magnesium acetate, hydrochloric acid, and potassium chloride can be substituted for salt in deicing, certain chemical processes, and food flavoring, but at a higher cost.'"
