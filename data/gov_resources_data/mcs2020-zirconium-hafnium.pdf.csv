MT,,2018,2019,2019.0,"'In 2019, two firms recovered zircon (zirconium silicate) from surface-mining operations in Florida and Georgia as a coproduct from the mining of heavy-mineral sands and the processing of titanium and zirconium mineral concentrates, and a third company processed existing mineral sands tailings in Florida. Zirconium metal and hafnium metal were produced from zirconium chemical intermediates by one producer in Oregon and one in Utah. Zirconium and hafnium are typically contained in zircon at a ratio of about 36 to 1. Zirconium chemicals were produced by the metal producer in Oregon and by at least 10 other companies. Ceramics, foundry sand, opacifiers, and refractories are the leading end uses for zircon. Other end uses of zircon include abrasives, chemicals (predominantly, zirconium basic sulfate and zirconium oxychloride octohydrate as intermediate chemicals), metal alloys, and welding rod coatings. The leading consumers of zirconium metal are the chemical process and nuclear energy industries. The leading use of hafnium metal is in superalloys.'",'Companies in Oregon and Utah recycled zirconium from new scrap generated during metal production and fabrication and (or) from post-commercial old scrap. Zircon foundry mold cores and spent or rejected zirconia refractories are often recycled. Hafnium metal recycling was insignificant.',"'The average unit value for imports of zircon concentrates increased for the third year in a row. The average unit value for exports of zircon concentrates rose slightly in 2019 compared with 2018. In China, zircon production was estimated to have decreased significantly. It was reported that China began conducting environmental inspections in July in the Provinces of Chongqing, Fujian, Gansu, Hainan, Qinghai, and Shanghai, which resulted in mine and plant closures, including zircon mines in Hainan Province. It was uncertain how long the mines and plants would be closed. During 2019, several large mining projects with zirconium were in development but construction had not begun on any them. In Western Australia, the Thunderbird mineral sands project received full permitting, secured a 15-year agreement with a provider of liquified natural gas, and was seeking full funding of the project. In New South Wales, Australia, the Dubbo polymetallic project also received full permitting and was seeking funding. In Siberia, construction was to begin in the second half of 2019 at the Tugan titanium-zirconium deposit but concerns regarding funding delayed the start of work.'",'Resources of zircon in the United States included about 14 million tons associated with titanium resources in heavy-mineral-sand deposits. Phosphate rock and sand and gravel deposits could potentially yield substantial amounts of zircon as a byproduct. World resources of hafnium are associated with those of zircon and baddeleyite. Quantitative estimates of hafnium resources are not available.',"'Chromite and olivine can be used instead of zircon for some foundry applications. Dolomite and spinel refractories can also substitute for zircon in certain high-temperature applications. Niobium (columbium), stainless steel, and tantalum provide limited substitution in nuclear applications, and titanium and synthetic materials may substitute in some chemical processing plant applications. Silver-cadmium-indium control rods are used in lieu of hafnium at numerous nuclear powerplants. Zirconium can be used interchangeably with hafnium in certain superalloys.'"
