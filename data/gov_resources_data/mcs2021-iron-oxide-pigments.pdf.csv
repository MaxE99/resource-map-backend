MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'Iron oxide pigments (IOPs) were mined domestically by two companies in Alabama and Georgia. Mine production, which was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data, decreased in 2020 from that of 2019. Five companies, including the two producers of natural IOPs, processed and sold about 26,000 tons of finished natural and synthetic IOPs with an estimated value of $15 million. About 46% of natural and synthetic finished IOPs were used in concrete and other construction materials; 13% for foundry sands and other foundry uses; 6% each in animal feed and industrial coatings; 5% for paint and coatings; 3% each in plastics, and glass and ceramics; and the remaining 18% in other uses.'",'None.',"'In 2020, domestic mine production of crude natural IOPs decreased compared with 2019 production owing to a major producer closing down multiple facilities. Production and sales of finished natural and synthetic IOPs increased by about 35% compared with those of 2019. Production and sales of synthetic IOPs also increased in 2020, owing in part to low mortgage interest rates and increased demand for single-family homes as the global COVID-19 pandemic made multifamily homes less desirable. In the United States, residential construction, in which IOPs are commonly used to color concrete block and brick, ready-mixed concrete, and roofing tiles, increased slightly during the first 9 months of 2020 compared with that of the same period in 2019. Housing starts increased by about 5% in 2020 compared with those of 2019. Exports of pigment-grade IOPs decreased by about 8% during the first 9 months of 2020 compared with those during the same period in 2019, mostly owing to a significant decrease in exports to Argentina, South Africa, and Spain. About 53% of pigment-grade IOPs went to Mexico, China, Thailand, Germany, Belgium, Chile, India, and Brazil, in descending order of quantity. Exports of other grades of iron oxides and hydroxides decreased by about 29% during the first 9 months of 2020 compared with those of the same period in 2019. About 92% of exports of other grades of iron oxides and hydroxides went to Germany, Colombia, Vietnam, and Canada, in descending order of quantity. Total imports of natural and synthetic IOPs increased by 13% in 2020 compared with those in 2019.'",'* Domestic and world resources for production of IOPs are adequate. Adequate resources are available worldwide for the manufacture of synthetic IOPs.',"'Milled |OPs are thought to be the most commonly used natural minerals for pigments. Because IOPs are color stable, low cost, and nontoxic, they can be economically used for imparting black, brown, red, and yellow coloring in large and relatively low-value applications. Other minerals may be used as colorants, but they generally cannot compete with IOPs because of their higher costs and more limited availability. Synthetic IOPs are widely used as colorants and compete with natural IOPs in many color applications. Organic colorants are used for some colorant applications, but many of the organic compounds fade over time from exposure to sunlight.'"
