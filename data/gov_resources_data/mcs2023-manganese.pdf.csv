1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'Manganese ore containing 20% or more manganese has not been produced domestically since 1970. Manganese ore was consumed mainly by five companies at six facilities with plants principally in the Eastern and Midwestern States. Most ore consumption was related to steel production, either directly in pig iron manufacture or indirectly through upgrading the ore to ferroalloys. Additional quantities of ore were used for nonmetallurgical purposes, such as in the production of animal feed, brick colorant, dry cell batteries, and fertilizers. Manganese ferroalloys were produced at two plants.'","'Manganese was recycled incidentally as a constituent of ferrous and nonferrous scrap; however, scrap recovery specifically for manganese was negligible. Manganese is recovered along with iron from steel slag.'","'Global production of steel, the leading use of manganese, decreased in 2022 compared with production in 2021 owing to supply chain disruptions resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and intermittent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related lockdowns in China. Global production of manganese ore was estimated to be unchanged from that in 2021. The leading countries for manganese ore production were, in descending order on a contained-weight basis, South Africa, Gabon, and Australia. On a contained-weight basis, total U.S. manganese imports were estimated to have increased by almost 20% in 2022 compared with those in 2021. By September 2022, average spot market prices for manganese ore, 44% grade, from China had increased by 23% compared with the annual average spot price in 2021.'",['Land-based manganese resources are large but irregularly distributed; those in the United States are very low grade and have potentially high extraction costs. South Africa accounts for an estimated 70% of the worlds manganese resources. ,'Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications.'
