MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'Significant U.S. niobium mine production has not been reported since 1959. Companies in the United States produced niobium-containing materials from imported niobium concentrates, oxides, and ferroniobium. Niobium was consumed mostly in the form of ferroniobium by the steel industry and as niobium alloys and metal by the aerospace industry. In 2019, there was a decrease in reported consumption of niobium for high-strength low alloy steel and superalloy applications. Major end-use distribution of reported niobium consumption was as follows: steels, about 78%, and superalloys, about 22%. The estimated value of niobium consumption was $460 million, as measured by the value of imports.'","'Niobium was recycled when niobium-bearing steels and superalloys were recycled; scrap recovery, specifically for niobium content, was negligible. The amount of niobium recycled is not available, but it may be as much as 20% of apparent consumption.'","'Niobium principally was imported in the form of ferroniobium. Based on data through August 2019, U.S. niobium apparent consumption (measured in contained niobium) for 2019 was estimated to be 9,900 tons, slightly less than that of 2018. Brazil continued to be the worlds leading niobium producer with 88% of global production, followed by Canada with 10%. Global niobium production is thought to have increased in 2019 owing to anticipated growing demand for ferroniobium from steel manufacturers in China following the countrys implementation of higher rebar strength standards beginning in November 2018. Niobium was increasingly substituted for vanadium as a microalloying additive in high-strength rebar owing to the supply deficit and high price volatility of ferrovanadium. Based on data through August 2019, ferroniobium imports into China were estimated to have increased by 50% in 2019 compared with the previous year. One domestic company developing its Elk Creek project in Nebraska announced a new mine design that was expected to increase the mine life by 4 years and reduce the environmental impacts of its operation. The new design included an onsite water treatment system that would eliminate the need to discharge excess process water into the nearby Missouri River, more efficient recycling of mineral-processing reagents, and the use of advanced emission control technologies that would result in reduced air emissions. The company submitted its construction air permit to the State of Nebraska in July. The project would be the only niobium mine and primary niobium processing facility in the United States. It was expected to begin production after 2020. In January, a leading niobium producer in Brazil announced plans to increase its annual ferroniobium production capacity by 50% to 150,000 tons (approximately 98,000 tons of contained niobium). The company expected to invest $200 million in the expansion which would be completed before the end of 2020.'","'World resources of niobium are more than adequate to supply projected needs. Most of the worlds identified resources of niobium occur as pyrochlore in carbonatite (igneous rocks that contain more than 50%- by-volume carbonate minerals) deposits and are outside the United States. The United States has approximately 1,400,000 tons of niobium in identified resources, most of which were considered subeconomic at 2019 prices for niobium.'","'The following materials can be substituted for niobium, but a performance loss or higher cost may ensue: ceramic matrix composites, molybdenum, tantalum, and tungsten in high-temperature (superalloy) applications; molybdenum, tantalum, and titanium as alloying elements in stainless and high-strength steels; and molybdenum and vanadium as alloying elements in high-strength low-alloy steels.'"
