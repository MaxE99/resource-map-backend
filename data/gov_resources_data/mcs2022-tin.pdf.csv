MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,"'Tin has not been mined or smelted in the United States since 1993 and 1989, respectively. Twenty-five firms accounted for over 90% of the primary tin consumed domestically in 2021. The major uses for tin in the United States were chemicals, 25%; tinplate, 22%; alloys, 12%; solder, 9%; babbitt, brass and bronze, and tinning, 8%; bar tin, 2%; and other, 22%. Based on the average S&P Global Platts Metals Week New York dealer price for tin, the estimated value of imported refined tin in 2021 was $1.2 billion, and the estimated value of tin recovered from old scrap domestically in 2021 was $342 million. '","'About 18,000 tons of tin from old and new scrap was estimated to have been recycled in 2021. Of this, about 10,000 tons was recovered from old scrap at 1 detinning plant and about 75 secondary nonferrous metal- processing plants, accounting for 23% of apparent consumption.'","'The estimated amount of tin recycled domestically in 2021 increased by 3% compared with that in 2020. The estimated annual average New York dealer price for refined tin in 2021 was 1,600 cents per pound, double that in 2020. The estimated annual average LME cash price for refined tin in 2021 was 1,500 cents per pound, a 93% increase from that in 2020. In 2021, the monthly average New York dealer tin price increased for 8 consecutive months from January through August. Supply constraints owing to shipping bottlenecks, reimposed COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, and an increased demand for electronic and consumer goods, were largely responsible for the almost doubling of refined tin prices during 2021. In March, the United States Defense Logistics Agency began offering stockpiled tin for sale. Throughout the year, global production struggled to maintain an adequate supply of refined tin to meet rebounding consumer demand. Pandemic-related measures, including shutdowns and border restrictions, affected refined tin production in Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Rwanda. Smelters were temporarily closed for repair and annual maintenance in China and Malaysia. Shipping container shortages and bottlenecks at shipping terminals exacerbated supply constraints. Globally, consumption increased in 2021 for alloys, chemicals, solder, and tinplate while demand for lead-acid batteries remained steady. '","'* Identified resources of tin in the United States, primarily in Alaska, were insignificant compared with those of the rest of the world. World resources, principally in western Africa, southeastern Asia, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, and Russia, are extensive and, if developed, could sustain recent annual production rates well into the future.'","'Aluminum, glass, paper, plastic, or tin-free steel substitute for tin in cans and containers. Other materials that substitute for tin are epoxy resins for solder; aluminum alloys, alternative copper-base alloys, and plastics for bronze; plastics for bearing metals that contain tin; and compounds of lead and sodium for some tin chemicals.'"
