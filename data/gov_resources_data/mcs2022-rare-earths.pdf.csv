MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,"'Rare earths were mined domestically in 2021. Bastnaesite (or bastnasite), a rare- earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was produced as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral concentrates in the southeastern United States. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2021 was $160 million, a significant increase from $109 million in 2020. The estimated end- use distribution of rare earths was as follows: catalysts, 74%; ceramics and glass, 10%; metallurgical applications and alloys, 6%; polishing, 4%; and other, 6%.'","'Limited quantities of rare earths are recovered from batteries, permanent magnets, and fluorescent lamps.'","'Global mine production was estimated to have increased to 280,000 tons of REO equivalent. According to Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the mine production quota for 2021 was 168,000 tons with 148,850 tons allocated to light rare earths and 19,150 tons to ion-adsorption clays.'","'Rare earths are relatively abundant in the Earths crust, but minable concentrations are less common than for most other mineral commodities. In North America, measured and indicated resources of rare earths were estimated to include 2.4 million tons in the United States and more than 15 million tons in Canada.'",'Substitutes are available for many applications but generally are less effective.'
