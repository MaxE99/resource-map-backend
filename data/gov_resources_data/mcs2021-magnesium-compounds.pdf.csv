1000 MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'Seawater and natural brines accounted for about 70% of U.S. magnesium compound production in 2020. The value of shipments of all types of magnesium compounds was estimated to be $360 million, essentially unchanged from the revised value in 2019. Magnesium oxide and other compounds were recovered from seawater by one company in California and another company in Delaware, from well brines by one company in Michigan, and from lake brines by two companies in Utah. Magnesite was mined by one company in Nevada. One company in Washington processed olivine that was mined previously for use as foundry sand. About 67% of the magnesium compounds consumed in the United States was used in agricultural, chemical, construction, deicing, environmental, and industrial applications in the form of caustic-calcined magnesia, magnesium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium sulfates. The remaining 33% was used for refractories in the form of dead- burned magnesia, fused magnesia, and olivine.'","'Some magnesia-based refractories are recycled, either for reuse as refractory material or for use as construction aggregate.'","'Consumption of dead-burned and fused magnesia in the United States decreased by 11% in 2020 compared with that in 2019. Global consumption of dead-burned and fused magnesia decreased by about 3% during the first 9 months of 2020 compared with that in the same period of 2019. Top domestic consumption of magnesium compounds, in descending order, were water treatment, deicing, chemical, and agriculture. The leading magnesium compounds consumed, in descending order, were magnesium oxide (caustic- calcined magnesia, dead burned magnesia, and fused magnesia), magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium chloride. The global COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease caused disruptions in many of the mining and manufacturing industries across the United States and around the world. Overall demand for magnesium compounds was lower in the first half of the year, rebounding to January levels by the third quarter as global lockdowns were eased. China remains the leading producer of magnesia and magnesite. Policy changes, coupled with the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in inconsistent supplies and restricted availability of all grades of magnesia in the world market. Pandemic-related closures of mining and manufacturing activities and reduced demand from downstream industries in early 2020 caused decreased steel production, a major consumer of refractory-grade magnesia. Air pollution controls scheduled to be imposed in major steel-producing Provinces during the autumn and winter months will further reduce consumption of refractory grade magnesia. Liaoning Province, a major source of Chinese magnesite, implemented a 6-month ban on the use of explosives that began on July 1. New open pit mines were banned as well. Export prices for dead-burned and fused magnesia from China decreased by about 13% from the start of the year to the end of September, which was likely caused by a decrease in demand owing to the impact of the global pandemic.'","'Resources from which magnesium compounds can be recovered range from large to virtually unlimited and are globally widespread. Identified world magnesite and brucite resources total 12 billion tons and several million tons, respectively. Resources of dolomite, forsterite, magnesium-bearing evaporite minerals, and magnesia-bearing brines are estimated to constitute a resource of billions of tons. Magnesium hydroxide can be recovered from seawater. Serpentine could be used as a source of magnesia but global resources, including in tailings of asbestos mines, have not been quantified but are thought to be very large.'","'Alumina, chromite, and silica substitute for magnesia in some refractory applications.'"
