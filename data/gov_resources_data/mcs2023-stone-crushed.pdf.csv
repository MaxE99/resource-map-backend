1 M. MT,,2021.0,2022.0,"In 2022, 1.5 billion tons of crushed stone valued at more than $21 billion was produced by an estimated 1,340 companies operating 3,290 quarries and 170 sales and (or) distribution yards in 50 States. Leading States were, in descending order of production, Texas, Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana, which together accounted for about 55% of total crushed stone output. Of the total domestic crushed stone produced in 2022, about 70% was limestone and dolomite; 15%, granite; 6%, traprock; 5%, miscellaneous stone; 3%, sandstone and quartzite; and the remaining 1% was divided, in descending order of tonnage, among marble, volcanic cinder and scoria, calcareous marl, slate, and shell. An estimated 74% of crushed stone was used as a construction aggregate, mostly for road construction and maintenance; 17% for cement manufacturing; 5% for lime manufacturing; 1% for agricultural uses; and the remaining 3% for other chemical, special, and miscellaneous uses and products. The output of crushed stone in the United States shipped for consumption in the first 9 months of 2022 was 1.14 billion tons, an increase of 3% compared with that in the same period in 2021. Third-quarter shipments for consumption increased by 3% compared with those in the same period in 2021. Additional production information, by quarter, for each State, geographic division, and the United States is reported by the U.S. Geological Survey in its quarterly Mineral Industry Surveys for construction sand and gravel and crushed stone.","Road surfaces made of asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete surface layers, which contain crushed stone aggregate, were recycled on a limited but increasing basis in most States. In 2022, asphalt and portland cement concrete road surfaces were recycled in all 50 States.","U.S. crushed stone production was about 1.50 billion tons in 2022, essentially unchanged compared with 1.50 billion tons in 2021. Apparent consumption increased to 1.6 billion tons. Consumption of crushed stone increased in 2022 because of growth in the private and public construction markets. Usually, commercial and heavy-industrial construction activity, infrastructure funding, labor availability, new single-family housing unit starts, and weather affect rates of crushed stone production and consumption. Long-term increases in construction aggregates demand are influenced by activity in the public and private construction sectors, as well as by construction work related to infrastructure improvements around the Nation. The underlying factors that would support a rise in prices of crushed stone are expected to be present in 2023, especially in and near metropolitan areas. The crushed stone industry continued to be concerned with environmental, health, safety, and zoning regulations. On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law. The legislation reauthorizes surface transportation programs for 5 years and invests $110 billion in additional funding to repair roads and bridges and support major, transformational projects. Shortages in some urban and industrialized areas are expected to continue to increase owing to local zoning regulations and land-development alternatives. These issues are expected to continue and to cause new crushed stone quarries to be located away from large population centers. Resultant regional shortages of crushed stone and higher fuel costs could result in higher-than-average price increases in industrialized and urban areas.",Stone resources are plentiful throughout the world. The supply of high-purity limestone and dolomite suitable for specialty uses is limited in many geographic areas. The largest resources of high-purity limestone and dolomite in the United States are in the central and eastern parts of the country.,"Crushed stone substitutes for roadbuilding include sand and gravel, and iron and steel slag. Substitutes for crushed stone used as construction aggregates include construction sand and gravel, iron and steel slag, sintered or expanded clay or shale, perlite, or vermiculite. Increasingly, recycled asphalt and portland cement concretes are being substituted for virgin aggregate, although the percentage of total aggregate supplied by recycled materials remained very small in 2022."
