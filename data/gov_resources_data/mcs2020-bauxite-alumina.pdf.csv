1000 MT,,2018,2019,2018,2019,2019,"'In 2019, the quantity of bauxite consumed was estimated to be 5.1 million tons, 30% more than that reported in 2018, with an estimated value of about $162 million. About 73% of the bauxite was refined by the Bayer process for alumina or aluminum hydroxide, and the remainder went to products such as abrasives, cement, chemicals, proppants, refractories, and as a slag adjuster in steel mills. Two domestic Bayer-process refineries with a combined alumina production capacity of 1.7 million tons per year produced an estimated 1.6 million tons in 2019, slightly more than that in 2018. One other refinery with 2.3 million tons per year of capacity that had been on care-and-maintenance status since 2016 was permanently shut down in December. About 66% of the alumina produced went to primary aluminum smelters, and the remainder went to nonmetallurgical products, such as abrasives, ceramics, chemicals, and refractories.'",'None.',"'In 2019, two domestic alumina refineries produced alumina from imported bauxite. A 500,000-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Burnside, LA, produced specialty-grade alumina. A 1.2-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Gramercy, LA, produced alumina principally for aluminum smelting. A project at the Gramercy refinery was adding another production line for specialty-grade alumina but the amount of additional capacity and a projected completion date were not announced. A 2.3-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Point Comfort, TX, was permanently shut down in December. The average prices free alongside ship (f.a.s.) for U.S. imports for consumption of crude-dry bauxite and metallurgical-grade alumina during the first 8 months of 2019 were $32 per ton, slightly more than that of the same period in 2018, and $497 per ton, 12% lower than that in the same period of 2018, respectively. In April, the Government of Malaysia ended its ban on bauxite mining that was imposed in January 2016 because of concerns about pollution from mines and uncovered stockpiles at ports. During the mining ban, exports of stockpiled bauxite were allowed and media sources reported that some mines continued illegal mining. In May, a court in Brazil lifted restrictions on production at a 6.3-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery. In February 2018, the Government of Brazil ordered the alumina refinery and a nearby 10-million-ton-per-year bauxite mine to shut down one-half of their capacities, citing concerns that leaks from disposal areas may have taken place after heavy rainfall in the area. The mine and refinery were ramped up to their full capacities by yearend. In March, a new 22.8-million-ton-per-year bauxite mine was commissioned in Queensland, Australia. In April, a new 2-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in the United Arab Emirates was commissioned. In August, a new 12-million-ton-per-year bauxite mine in Guinea was commissioned and started exporting bauxite to the alumina refinery in the United Arab Emirates for which it would be the principal bauxite source. In October, a 1.65-million-ton-per-year alumina refinery in Jamaica shut down for a modernization project that would take about 2 years to complete. In January, the U.S. Department of the Treasury lifted sanctions that were imposed in April 2018 against several Russian individuals and businesses in response to activities of the Government of Russia. Among the designated companies was a producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum. Prior to the sanctions being lifted, a winddown period was granted to companies with contracts with the sanctioned company. The winddown period was extended several times until the sanctions were lifted and deliveries to consumers in the United States were not disrupted. '","'Bauxite resources are estimated to be 55 billion to 75 billion tons, in Africa (32%), Oceania (23%), South America and the Caribbean (21%), Asia (18%), and elsewhere (6%). Domestic resources of bauxite are inadequate to meet long-term U.S. demand, but the United States and most other major aluminum-producing countries have essentially inexhaustible subeconomic resources of aluminum in materials other than bauxite.'","'Bauxite is the only raw material used in the production of alumina on a commercial scale in the United States. Although currently not economically competitive with bauxite, vast resources of clay are technically feasible sources of alumina. Other raw materials, such as alunite, anorthosite, coal wastes, and oil shales, offer additional potential alumina sources. Synthetic mullite, produced from kaolin, bauxitic kaolin, kyanite, and sillimanite, substitutes for bauxite-based refractories. Silicon carbide and alumina-zirconia can substitute for abrasives but cost more.'"
