$ M.,,2020,2021,"'The combined value of U.S. natural and synthetic gemstone output in 2021 was an estimated $95 million, a 25% increase compared with that in 2020. Domestic gemstone production included agate, beryl, coral, diamond, garnet, jade, jasper, opal, pearl, quartz, sapphire, shell, topaz, tourmaline, turquoise, and many other gem materials. In descending order of production value, Arizona led the Nation in natural gemstone production and Oregon was second. The other top producing States were Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah. These 13 States produced 96% of U.S. natural gemstones. Synthetic gemstones were manufactured by five companies in California, North Carolina, New York, Maryland, and Arizona, in decreasing order of production value. U.S. synthetic gemstone production increased by 29% compared with that in 2020. Major gemstone end uses were carvings, gem and mineral collections, and jewelry.'","'Gemstones are often recycled by being resold as estate jewelry, reset, or recut, but this report does not account for those stones.'","'During 2021, the U.S. and global gemstone and jewelry industries began recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, lockdowns, and temporary mine and store closings. The largest production decreases in 2020 were from Australia, Botswana, Canada, and Russia. Total world diamond production during 2021 increased slightly from 2020 levels and was driven by the reopening of profitable mines that were suspended in 2020. Production would need to increase by up to 2% per year during the next 3 to 5 years to allow the market to fully rebalance. New sales platforms were established during 2020 and remained in place during 2021 in the rough diamond market to overcome travel constraints and streamline the journey from the mine to the jeweler. Online auctions gained a higher share of rough diamond sales and offset deficits in traditional sales channels. Many jewelry stores successfully shifted sales to their websites. Global gemstone sales are expected to increase at a steady rate over the next 5 years. In 2021, U.S. imports for consumption of gemstones were about $24 billion, which was a 49% increase compared with $16.3 billion in 2020. These imports consisted of about $21 billion in gem-quality diamonds, which was a 49% increase compared with $14.3 billion in 2020, and about $2.9 billion in nondiamond gemstones, which was a 51% increase compared with $1.9 billion in 2020. The increase in U.S. gem production combined with the growth in U.S. gem imports and the decrease in gem exports produced a 52% increase in apparent consumption to a value of $23 billion. The United States was the leading global market in terms of sales. The United States is expected to continue to dominate global gemstone demand. '","' Most diamond ore bodies have a diamond content that ranges from less than 1 carat per ton to about 6 carats per ton of ore. The major diamond reserves are in southern Africa, Australia, Canada, and Russia.'","'Glass, plastics, and other materials are substituted for natural gemstones. Synthetic gemstones (manufactured materials that have the same chemical and physical properties as natural gemstones) are common substitutes. Simulants (materials that appear to be gems but differ in chemical and physical characteristics) also are frequently substituted for natural gemstones.'"
