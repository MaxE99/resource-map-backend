kg,,2021.0,2022.0,2022,"'During 2022, rhenium-containing products including ammonium perrhenate (APR), metal powder, and perrhenic acid were produced as byproducts from roasting molybdenum concentrates from porphyry copper-molybdenum deposits in Arizona and Montana. U.S. primary production was approximately 9,000 kilograms in 2022, a 3% decrease from that in 2021. The United States continued to be a leading producer of secondary rhenium, recovering rhenium from nickel-base superalloy scrap, spent oil-refining catalysts, and foundry revert. The major uses of rhenium were in superalloys used in high-temperature turbine engine components and in petroleum-reforming catalysts, representing an estimated 80% and 15%, respectively, of end uses. Bimetallic platinum-rhenium catalysts were used in petroleum reforming for the production of high-octane hydrocarbons, which are used in the production of lead-free gasoline. Rhenium improves the high-temperature (>1,000 degrees Celsius) strength properties of some nickel-base superalloys. Rhenium alloys were used in crucibles, electrical contacts, electromagnets, electron tubes and targets, heating elements, ionization gauges, mass spectrographs, metallic coatings, semiconductors, temperature controls, thermocouples, vacuum tubes, and other applications.'","'Nickel-base superalloy scrap and scrapped turbine blades and vanes continued to be recycled hydrometallurgically to produce rhenium metal for use in new superalloy melts. The scrapped parts were also processed to generate engine reverta high-quality, lower cost superalloy meltstockby an increasing number of companies, mainly in Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Russia, and the United States. Rhenium- containing catalysts were also recycled. The rhenium recycled from spent catalysts was either returned to the oil companies or to the catalyst producer for production of new catalysts in what is considered a closed-loop system.'","'In 2022, the price of catalytic-grade APR averaged $910 per kilogram, a 6% increase rom the annual average price in 2021. The rhenium metal pellet price averaged $1,100 per kilogram in 2022, a 15% increase from the annual average price in 2021. In 2022, apparent consumption in the United States was 8% less than that in 2021. During 2022, the United States continued to rely on imports for much of its supply of rhenium. Canada, Chile, Germany, Kazakhstan, and Poland supplied most of the imported rhenium. Imports of APR increased by 66% in 2022 compared with those in the previous year. Imports of rhenium metal decreased by 37% in 2022 compared with those in the previous year. World rhenium production in 2022 decreased slightly compared with that in 2021. The United States and Germany continued to be the leading secondary rhenium producers. Secondary rhenium production also took place in Canada, Estonia, France, Japan, Poland, and Russia. Available information was insufficient to make U.S. secondary production estimates; however, industry sources estimated U.S. capacity was between 18,000 and 20,000 kilograms per year of rhenium. Industry sources estimated that approximately 25,000 kilograms of secondary rhenium was produced worldwide in 2022. There were no primary rhenium projects in 2022 that were expected to significantly contribute to rhenium availability in the near future. On February 24, 2022, a final U.S. critical minerals list was published in the Federal Register (87 FR 10381). The 2022 critical minerals list was an update of the list of critical minerals published in 2018 in the Federal Register (83 FR 23295). The 2022 critical minerals list contained 50 individual mineral commodities instead of 35 minerals and mineral groups. The changes in the 2022 list from the prior list were the addition of nickel and zinc and the removal of helium, potash, rhenium, strontium, and uranium. The list is to be updated every 3 years and revised as necessary consistent with available data. '","'Most rhenium occurs with molybdenum in porphyry copper deposits. Identified U.S. resources are estimated to be about 7 million kilograms. Rhenium also is associated with copper minerals in sedimentary deposits in Armenia, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, and Uzbekistan, where ore is processed for copper recovery and the rhenium-bearing residues are recovered at copper smelters.'","'Substitutes for rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts are continually being evaluated. Iridium and tin have achieved commercial success in one such application. Other metals being evaluated for catalytic use include gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, silicon, tungsten, and vanadium. The use of these and other metals in bimetallic catalysts might decrease rheniums share of the existing catalyst market; however, this would likely be offset by rhenium-bearing catalysts being considered for use in several proposed gas-to-liquid projects. Materials that can substitute for rhenium in various end uses are as follows: cobalt and tungsten for coatings on copper X-ray targets, rhodium and rhodium-iridium for high-temperature thermocouples, tungsten and platinum-ruthenium for coatings on electrical contacts, and tungsten and tantalum for electron emitters.'"
