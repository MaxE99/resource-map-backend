kg,,2019.0,2020.0,2020.0,"'During 2020, rhenium-containing products including ammonium perrhenate (APR), metal powder, and perrhenic acid were produced as byproducts from roasting molybdenum concentrates from porphyry copper-molybdenum deposits in Arizona and Montana. U.S. primary production was approximately'","'Nickel-base superalloy scrap and scrapped turbine blades and vanes continued to be recycled hydrometallurgically to produce rhenium metal for use in new superalloy melts. The scrapped parts were also processed to generate engine reverta high-quality, lower cost superalloy meltstockby an increasing number of companies, mainly in the United States, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, and Russia. Rhenium- containing catalysts were also recycled.'","'In 2020, rhenium production in the United States decreased by 6% compared with that in 2019. A rhenium recovery facility in Utah was closed in 2019; however, the company announced the possibility of reopening the facility in the near future. During 2020, the United States continued to rely on imports for much of its supply of rhenium. Canada, Chile, Germany, and Kazakhstan supplied most of the imported rhenium. Imports of APR decreased by 16% in 2020 compared with the previous year. Imports of rhenium metal decreased by 57% in 2020 compared with the previous year. This large decrease in rhenium metal imports was attributed in part to lower consumption by the aerospace industry owing to travel lockdown measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced production of airplanes. Additionally, mine production of rhenium-containing feedstocks was lower in 2020. The United States and Germany continued to be the leading secondary rhenium producers. Secondary rhenium production also took place in Canada, Estonia, France, Japan, Poland, and Russia. According to industry sources, approximately 20 to 25 tons of rhenium was recycled worldwide in 2020. For the ninth year in a row, rhenium metal and catalytic-grade APR prices decreased. In 2020, catalytic-grade APR prices averaged $1,100 per kilogram, a 12% decrease from the annual average price in 2019. Rhenium metal pellet prices averaged $1,000 per kilogram in 2020, a 20% decrease from the annual average price in 2019. There were no primary rhenium projects in 2020 that were expected to significantly contribute to rhenium availability in the near future. Continued low prices of rhenium as well as the global COVID-19 pandemic caused many rhenium recyclers as well as primary-rhenium production facilities to stop recycling or producing rhenium to focus on a more profitable market. The major aerospace companies were expected to continue testing superalloys that contain one-half the quantity of rhenium used in engine blades as currently designed, as well as testing rhenium-free alloys for other engine components. '","' Most rhenium occurs with molybdenum in porphyry copper deposits. Identified U.S. resources are estimated to be about 7 million kilograms. Rhenium also is associated with copper minerals in sedimentary deposits in Armenia, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, and Uzbekistan, where ore is processed for copper recovery and the rhenium-bearing residues are recovered at copper smelters.'","'Substitutes for rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts are being evaluated continually. Iridium and tin have achieved commercial success in one such application. Other metals being evaluated for catalytic use include gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, silicon, tungsten, and vanadium. The use of these and other metals in bimetallic catalysts might decrease rheniums share of the existing catalyst market; however, this would likely be offset by rhenium-bearing catalysts being considered for use in several proposed gas-to-liquid projects. Materials that can substitute for rhenium in various end uses are as follows: cobalt and tungsten for coatings on copper x-ray targets, rhodium and rhodium-iridium for high-temperature thermocouples, tungsten and platinum-ruthenium for coatings on electrical contacts, and tungsten and tantalum for electron emitters.'"
