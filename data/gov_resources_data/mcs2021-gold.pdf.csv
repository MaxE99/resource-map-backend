MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'In 2020, domestic gold mine production was estimated to be about 190 tons, 5% less than that in 2019, and the value was estimated to be about $11 billion. Gold was produced in 11 States (gold mining in Montana ceased in 2019) at more than 40 lode mines, at several large placer mines in Alaska, and numerous smaller placer mines (mostly in Alaska and in the Western States). About 7% of domestic gold was recovered as a byproduct of processing domestic base-metal ores, chiefly copper ores. The top 26 operations yielded about 99% of the mined gold produced in the United States. Commercial-grade gold was produced at about'","'In 2020, an estimated 120 tons of new and old scrap was recycled, equivalent to about 75% of reported consumption. The domestic supply of gold from recycling increased slightly compared with that of 2019.'","'The United States was not a net exporter of gold in 2020 for the first time since 2010 owing to a significant increase in imports of high-purity gold bullion. The estimated gold price in 2020 was 26% higher than the price in 2019, and 5% higher than the previous record-high annual price in 2012. The Engelhard daily price of gold in 2020 fluctuated through several cycles. Early in the year the gold price was about of $1,580 per troy ounce before decreasing in March and increasing to an alltime high of about $2,060 per troy ounce in August. During this time, several factors were reported to have caused the increase in price: gold demand increased to safe-haven buying as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and global investor uncertainty; the U.S. Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates; and trade negotiations halted between the United States and China. The price started a downward trend in October and November. The 5% decrease in domestic mine production in 2020 was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, worldwide gold mine production was estimated to be 3% less than that in 2019. Mine production remained unchanged in Argentina, China, Mali, and Sudan, and was slightly less in Australia, Canada, Ghana, and Russia compared with that of 2019. In the first 9 months of 2020, global consumption in physical bars decreased by about 16%, in jewelry by 41%, and in industrial applications by 10%; however, gold consumption in official coins and medals and imitation coins increased by 33% compared with that of the first 9 months of 2019. Global investments in gold-based exchange-traded funds increased by almost 168%, while gold holdings in central banks decreased by about 58% during the same period.'","'An assessment of U.S. gold resources indicated 33,000 tons of gold in identified (15,000 tons) and undiscovered (18,000 tons) resources.10 Nearly one-quarter of the gold in undiscovered resources was estimated to be contained in porphyry copper deposits. The gold resources in the United States, however, are only a small portion of global gold resources.'","'Base metals clad with gold alloys are widely used in electrical and electronic products, and in jewelry to economize on gold; many of these products are continually redesigned to maintain high-utility standards with lower gold content. Generally, palladium, platinum, and silver may substitute for gold.'"
