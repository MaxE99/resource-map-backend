MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'Significant U.S. tantalum mine production has not been reported since 1959. Domestic tantalum resources are of low grade, some are mineralogically complex, and most are not commercially recoverable. Companies in the United States produced tantalum alloys, capacitors, carbides, compounds, and tantalum metal from imported tantalum ores and concentrates and tantalum-containing materials. Tantalum metal and alloys were recovered from foreign and domestic scrap. Domestic tantalum consumption was not reported by consumers. Major end uses for tantalum included alloys for gas turbines used in the aerospace and oil and gas industries; tantalum capacitors for automotive electronics, mobile phones, and personal computers; tantalum carbides for cutting and boring tools; and tantalum oxide (Ta2Os) was used in glass lenses to make lighter weight camera lenses that produce a brighter image. The value of tantalum consumed in 2019 was estimated to exceed $270 million as measured by the value of imports.'","'Tantalum was recycled mostly from new scrap that was generated during the manufacture of tantalum- containing electronic components, and from tantalum-containing cemented carbide and superalloy scrap. The amount of tantalum recycled was not available, but it may be as much as 30% of apparent consumption.'","['U.S. tantalum apparent consumption (measured in contained tantalum) was estimated to have decreased by 11% from that of 2018. U.S. imports for consumption decreased by 21% from those of 2018. U.S. domestic exports decreased by 35% from those of 2018. The overall decrease in tantalum trade in 2019 was attributed to decreases in the trade of tantalum ores and concentrates (43% decrease in exports  26% decrease in imports) and tantalum scrap (60% decrease in exports; 28% decrease in imports). Congo (Kinshasa) and Rwanda accounted for 60% of estimated global tantalum production in 2019. In 2019, the average monthly price of tantalum ore decreased to about $158 per kilogram of Ta2O5 content in October from about $173 per kilogram of Ta2O5 content in January. This average monthly price in 2019 represented a decrease of about 26% from the average monthly price in 2018. The decrease in tantalum ore prices in 2019 was largely driven by an increasing supply of low-cost byproduct tantalum concentrates from two lithium operations in Western Australia. However, in August one of the two producing companies began scaling back operations and planned to place its Bald Hill Mine on care-and-maintenance status owing to slower than expected demand growth for lithium and a sharp decline in lithium prices between 2018 and 2019. The second company, which operated the Pilgangoora project, postponed a planned yearend 2019 expansion that would have more than doubled its lithium and tantalum production capacities. In July, a specialty metals processor in Estonia suspended its niobium and tantalum recovery operations. The company reached its limit for onsite storage of the radioactive tailings that were produced during recovery of niobium and tantalum. The Ministry of Environment of Estonia required the company to have an agreement for offsite storage or disposal of the radioactive tailings before it could resume recovery operations.", 26% decrease in imports) and tantalum scrap (60% decrease in exports, 28% decrease in imports). Congo (Kinshasa) and Rwanda accounted for 60% of estimated global tantalum production in 2019.'],"['Identified world resources of tantalum, most of which are in Australia, Brazil, and Canada, are\nconsidered adequate to supply projected needs. The United States has about 55,000 tons of tantalum resources in\nidentified deposits, most of which were considered uneconomic at 2019 prices for tantalum.']","['The following materials can be substituted for tantalum, but a performance loss or higher costs may\nensue: niobium and tungsten in carbides; aluminum, ceramics, and niobium in electronic capacitors; glass,\nmolybdenum, nickel, niobium, platinum, stainless steel, titanium, and zirconium in corrosion-resistant applications;\nand hafnium, iridium, molybdenum, niobium, rhenium, and tungsten in high-temperature applications.']"
