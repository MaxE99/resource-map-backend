1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'Lead was produced domestically by five lead mines in Missouri plus as a byproduct at two zinc mines in Alaska and two silver mines in Idaho. The value of the lead in concentrates of ore mined in 2022 was an estimated $710 million, 3% less than that in 2021. Nearly all lead concentrate production has been exported since the last primary lead refinery closed in 2013. The value of the secondary lead produced in 2022 was $2.4 billion, essentially unchanged from that in 2021. The lead-acid battery industry accounted for an estimated 92% of reported U.S. lead consumption during 2022. Lead-acid batteries were primarily used as starting-lighting-ignition (SLI) batteries for automobiles, as industrial-type batteries for standby power for computer and telecommunications networks, and for motive power. '","'In 2022, an estimated 950,000 tons of secondary lead was produced, an amount equivalent to 59% of apparent domestic consumption. Nearly all secondary lead was recovered from old scrap, mostly lead-acid batteries.'","'During the first 10 months of 2022, the average LME cash price for lead was 97 cents per pound, essentially unchanged from the annual average price in 2021. Global stocks of lead in LME-approved warehouses were 27,625 tons at the end of October, which was 49% less than those at yearend 2021. In 2022, domestic mine production and production of secondary lead decreased by an estimated 5% and 3%, respectively, from that in 2021. U.S. apparent consumption of refined lead increased slightly from that in 2021, and the net import reliance increased to 42% from 38%. In the first 9 months of 2022, 24.6 million spent SLI lead-acid batteries were exported, 4% less than exports in the same period in 2021. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group,6 global refined lead production in 2022 was forecast to decrease by 0.3% to 12.34 million tons and refined lead consumption to increase by 0.8% to 12.42 million tons. '","' Identified world lead resources total more than 2 billion tons. In recent years, significant lead resources have been identified in association with zinc and (or) silver or copper deposits in Australia, China, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Russia, and the United States (Alaska).'","'Substitution by plastics has reduced the use of lead in cable covering and cans. Tin has replaced lead in solder for potable water systems. The electronics industry has moved toward lead-free solders and flat-panel displays that do not require lead shielding. Steel and zinc are common substitutes for lead in wheel weights. Lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, and nickel-metal hydride batteries are common alternatives to lead-acid batteries in certain applications. Currently, most all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries.'"
