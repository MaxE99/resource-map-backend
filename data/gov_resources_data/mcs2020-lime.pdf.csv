1000 MT,,2018,2019,"'In 2019, an estimated 18 million tons of quicklime and hydrate was produced (excluding independent commercial hydrators2), valued at about $2.4 billion. At yearend, 28 companies were producing lime, which included 18 companies with commercial sales and 10 companies that produced lime strictly for internal use (for example, sugar companies). These companies had 74 primary lime plants (plants operating quicklime kilns) in 28 States and Puerto Rico. Six of these 28 companies operated only hydrating plants in 11 States. In 2019, the five leading U.S. lime companies produced quicklime or hydrate in 21 States and accounted for about 80% of U.S. lime production. Principal producing States were, in alphabetical order, Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Texas. Major markets for lime were, in descending order of consumption, steelmaking, chemical and industrial applications (such as the manufacture of fertilizer, glass, paper and pulp, and precipitated calcium carbonate, and in sugar refining), flue gas treatment, construction, water treatment, and nonferrous mining.'",'Large quantities of lime are regenerated by paper mills. Some municipal water-treatment plants regenerate lime from softening sludge. Quicklime is regenerated from waste hydrated lime in the carbide industry. Data for these sources were not included as production in order to avoid duplication.',"'In 2019, domestic lime production was estimated to have remained essentially unchanged from that of 2018. In 2018, one sugar cooperative finalized its decision to close the sugar beet facility in Torrington, WY, in 2019, thereby removing one quicklime kiln from production. Another company sold its quicklime and hydrate production plant in Calera, AL, which reduced the number of companies producing lime. As a result, the total number of operating quicklime plants remained at 74 in 2019. Hydrated lime is a dry calcium hydroxide powder made from reacting quicklime with a controlled amount of water in a hydrator. It is used in chemical and industrial, construction, and environmental applications. In 2019, the leading uses of hydrated lime were chemical and industrial, and construction applications; flue gas desulfurization; and water treatment.'",'Domestic and world resources of limestone and dolomite suitable for lime manufacture are very large.',"'Limestone is a substitute for lime in many applications, such as agriculture, fluxing, and sulfur removal. Limestone, which contains less reactive material, is slower to react and may have other disadvantages compared with lime, depending on the application; however, limestone is considerably less expensive than lime. Calcined gypsum is an alternative material in industrial plasters and mortars. Cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, and lime kiln dust are potential substitutes for some construction uses of lime. Magnesium hydroxide is a substitute for lime in pH control, and magnesium oxide is a substitute for dolomitic lime as a flux in steelmaking.'"
