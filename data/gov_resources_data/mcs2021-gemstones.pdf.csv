$ M.,,2019,2020,"'The combined value of U.S. natural and synthetic gemstone output in 2020 was an estimated $99 million, a 4% decrease compared with that of 2019. Domestic gemstone production included agate, beryl, coral, diamond, garnet, jade, jasper, opal, pearl, quartz, sapphire, shell, topaz, tourmaline, turquoise, and many other gem materials. In descending order of production value, Arizona, Oregon, California, Nevada, Montana, Maine, Arkansas, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Tennessee, North Carolina, and New York produced 95% of U.S. natural gemstones. Synthetic gemstones were manufactured by five companies in California, North Carolina, New York, Maryland, and Arizona, in decreasing order of production value. U.S. synthetic gemstone production decreased by 4% compared with that in 2019. Major gemstone end uses were carvings, gem and mineral collections, and jewelry.'","'Gemstones are often recycled by being resold as estate jewelry, reset, or recut, but this report does not account for those stones.'","'During 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic affected the U.S. gemstone and jewelry industries. As the restrictions, lockdowns, and store closings were imposed, many jewelry stores initially saw reduced sales but later in the year successfully shifted sales to their websites. Monthly U.S. gemstone imports declined from March through August, with the largest decrease year-on-year of 96% happening in April. U.S. apparent consumption of gemstones decreased by 32%. All major U.S. gemstone trade shows were canceled from March through August. In 2020, U.S. imports for consumption of gem-quality diamonds were estimated to be about $15 billion, which was a 31% decrease compared with $21.7 billion in 2019. U.S. imports for consumption of natural, nondiamond gemstones were estimated to be about $2.1 billion, which was a 22% decrease compared with $2.7 billion in 2019. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States was once again the leading global market in terms of consumer demand. The United States is expected to continue to dominate global gemstone demand. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the global diamond industry with temporary diamond mine closings around the world and disruptions of the supply chain. Demand for diamonds plummeted during the pandemic, halting sales. Only demand for large, high-quality diamonds remained stable, and their prices increased steadily during the year. The pandemic forced mining companies to cancel or delay sales, and major diamond trade shows were canceled owing to health and travel restrictions. Rough diamond prices declined by between 15% and 27% at the few sales that took place, and the rough diamond market was not operating normally during the second quarter. In India, where about 80% of the worlds diamonds are polished, cutting centers experienced major disruptions as gem workers contracted the virus. Imports of rough diamonds in India decreased from $1.5 billion in February to $1 million in April. Antwerp experienced a 20% drop in rough imports and a 46% decline in exports of polished diamonds. Worldwide, many temporary mine closures resulting from the pandemic, had yet to reopen and were at risk of becoming permanent. Many mining companies sought credit protection or were restructuring their credit. The global diamond jewelry market had an estimated value of $80 billion in 2019 and was expected to decline by 19% in 2020. Total world diamond production during 2020 decreased by 10% from 2019 levels. This decline was attributed to pandemic mine closures and mines becoming depleted.'","' Most diamond ore bodies have a diamond content that ranges from less than 1 carat per ton to about 6 carats per ton of ore. The major diamond reserves are in southern Africa, Australia, Canada, and Russia.'","'Glass, plastics, and other materials are substituted for natural gemstones. Synthetic gemstones (manufactured materials that have the same chemical and physical properties as natural gemstones) are common substitutes. Simulants (materials that appear to be gems but differ in chemical and physical characteristics) also are frequently substituted for natural gemstones.'"
