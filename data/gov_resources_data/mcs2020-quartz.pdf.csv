kg,"Industrial cultured quartz crystal is electronic-grade quartz crystal that is manufactured, not mined. In the past, cultured quartz crystal was primarily produced using lascas1 as raw quartz feed material. Lascas mining and processing in Arkansas ended in 1997. Anectodal evidence indicated that two companies produced cultured quartz crystal in the United States, but production statistics were not available. In addition to lascas, these companies may use cultured quartz crystal that has been rejected during the manufacturing process, owing to crystallographic imperfections, as feed material. The companies may use a mix of cultured quartz and imported lascas as feed material. In the past several years, cultured quartz crystal has been increasingly produced overseas, primarily in Asia. Electronic applications accounted for most industrial uses of quartz crystal; other uses included special optical applications. Virtually all quartz crystal used for electronics was cultured, rather than natural, crystal. Electronic-grade quartz crystal is used to make frequency filters, frequency controls, and timers in electronic circuits employed for a wide range of products, such as communications equipment, computers, and many consumer goods, such as electronic games and television receivers.",An unspecified amount of rejected cultured quartz crystal was used as feed material for the production of cultured quartz crystal.,"Demand for cultured quartz crystal for frequency-control oscillators and frequency filters in a variety of electronic devices is expected to remain stable. However, silicon has replaced quartz crystal in two very important marketscellular telephones and other mobile devices and automotive stability control applications. Growth of the consumer electronics market, for products such as personal computers, electronic games, and tablet computers, is likely to continue to sustain global production of cultured quartz crystal.","Limited resources of natural quartz crystal suitable for direct electronic or optical use are available throughout the world. World dependence on these resources will continue to decline because of the increased acceptance of cultured quartz crystal as an alternative material. Additionally, techniques using rejected cultured quartz crystal as feed material could mean a decreased dependence on lascas for growing cultured quartz.","Silicon is increasingly being used as a substitute for quartz crystal for frequency-control oscillators in electronic circuits. Other materials, such as aluminum orthophosphate (the very rare mineral berlinite), langasite, lithium niobate, and lithium tantalate, which have larger piezoelectric coupling constants, have been studied and used. The cost competitiveness of these materials, as opposed to cultured quartz crystal, is dependent on the type of application that the material is used for and the processing required."
