1 M. MT,,2018,2019,2018,2019,"'The U.S. iron and steel industry produced raw steel in 2019 with an estimated value of about $92 billion, an 11% decrease from $103 billion in 2018 and a 9% increase from $84 billion in 2017. Pig iron and raw steel was produced by three companies operating integrated steel mills in nine locations. Fifty companies produced raw steel at 98 minimills. Combined production capacity was about 111 million tons. Indiana accounted for an estimated 26% of total raw steel production, followed by Ohio, 12%; Michigan, 5%; and Pennsylvania, 5%, with no other State having more than 5% of total domestic raw steel production. Construction accounted for an estimated 44% of total domestic shipments by market classification, followed by transportation (predominantly automotive), 28%; machinery and equipment, 9%; energy, 6%; appliances, 5%; and other applications, 8%.'",'See Iron and Steel Scrap and Iron and Steel Slag.',"'After several Presidential proclamations were issued in 2018 imposing 25% ad valorem tariffs on steel imports from most countries of origin under the authority of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (83 FR 11625), the President of the United States modified proclamation 9705 and issued two additional proclamations in 2019. Presidential Proclamation 9886, issued in May 2019, reduced the ad valorem tariff on steel imports from Turkey to 25% from 50%. Also, in May 2019, Proclamation 9894 removed the Section 232 tariffs for steel imports from Canada and Mexico. Steel imports from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the Republic of Korea still required a 25% ad valorem tariff. In September 2018, March 2019, and June 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued additional guidance in the Federal Register for companies to request product exemptions from the Section 232 tariffs. The World Steel Association8 forecast global finished steel demand to increase by 3.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, as a result of real estate investment in China and 4.1% growth in emerging and developing economies in 2020. Steel consumption in developed economies, except for China, was expected to remain the same or decrease slightly in 2019 despite growth in consumer and construction applications as potential and enacted trade policies affected investments and exports among the manufacturing sector. Growth of the construction sectors in 2019 and 2020 was expected to decrease slightly in the United States, as well as in the European Union, Latin America, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. In other countries in Asia, including India, Government stimulus was expected to increase demand in the construction sector. Automotive production rates were expected to decrease in 2019 in China, Germany, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey.'",'Not applicable. See Iron Ore and Iron and Steel Scrap for steelmaking raw-material resources.',"'Iron is the least expensive and most widely used metal. In most applications, iron and steel compete either with less expensive nonmetallic materials or with more expensive materials that have a performance advantage. Iron and steel compete with lighter materials, such as aluminum and plastics, in the motor vehicle industry; aluminum, concrete, and wood in construction; and aluminum, glass, paper, and plastics in containers.'"
