1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'One company located in Virginia produced approximately 100,000 tons of vermiculite concentrate; data have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand tons to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Flakes of raw vermiculite concentrate are micaceous in appearance and contain interlayer water in their structure. When the flakes are heated rapidly to a temperature above 870 degrees Celsius, the water flashes into steam, and the flakes expand into accordionlike particles. This process is called exfoliation or expansion, and the resulting ultralightweight material is chemically inert, fire resistant, and odorless. Most vermiculite concentrate, whether produced in the United States or imported, was shipped to 15 exfoliating plants in nine States. The end uses for exfoliated vermiculite were estimated to be agriculture and horticulture, 32%; lightweight concrete aggregates (including cement premixes, concrete, and plaster), 25%; insulation, 13%; and other, 30%.'",'Insignificant.',"'In recent years, two companies mined crude vermiculite domestically; however, a company with operations in South Carolina did not expect to produce vermiculite in 2022. Data for U.S. exports and imports of vermiculite were combined with data for other mineral products by the U.S. Census Bureau. U.S. imports were estimated to be about 30,000 tons in 2022, a decrease which could be related to disruptions in the global supply chain. Most imports came from Brazil and South Africa in 2022. Historically, South Africa was the leading principal source of imports; however, in 2022, Brazil supplied more imports than South Africa. Exploration and development of vermiculite deposits containing medium, large, and premium (coarser) grades (greater than 5-millimeter particle size) are likely to continue because of the higher demand for those grades. Demand for vermiculite remains strong. With less domestic production, as well as global supply issues, vermiculite exfoliation operations are experiencing difficulties obtaining crude vermiculite (especially medium and coarse grade), which is increasing lead times and could result in consumers using substitute materials. Producers will continue to investigate ways to increase the use of the finer grades in existing products and as a substitute for coarser vermiculite while continuing to develop new and innovative applications. '","'In addition to the producing mine in Virginia, there are vermiculite occurrences in Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming that contain estimated resources of 2 million to 3 million tons. Significant deposits have been reported in Australia, Russia, Uganda, and some other countries, but reserve and resource information comes from many sources, and in most cases, it is not clear whether the numbers refer to vermiculite alone or vermiculite plus other minerals and host rock and overburden.'","'Expanded perlite is a substitute for exfoliated vermiculite in lightweight concrete and plaster. Other denser but less costly alternatives in these applications include expanded clay, shale, slag, and slate. Alternate materials for loose-fill fireproofing insulation include fiberglass, perlite, and slag wool. In agriculture, substitutes include bark and other plant materials, peat, perlite, sawdust, and synthetic soil conditioners.'"
