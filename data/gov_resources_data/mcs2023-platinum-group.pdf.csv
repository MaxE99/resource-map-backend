kg,,2021,2022,2021,2022,2022.0,"'One company in Montana produced PGMs with an estimated value of about $880 million. Small quantities of primary PGMs also were recovered as byproducts of copper-nickel mining in Michigan; however, this material was sold to foreign companies for refining. The leading domestic use for PGMs was in catalytic converters to decrease harmful emissions from automobiles. PGMs are also used in catalysts for bulk- chemical production and petroleum refining; dental and medical devices; electronic applications, such as in computer hard disks, hybridized integrated circuits, and multilayer ceramic capacitors; glass manufacturing; investment; jewelry; and laboratory equipment.'","'About 110,000 kilograms of palladium and platinum was recovered globally from new and old scrap in 2022, including about 40,000 kilograms of palladium and 11,000 kilograms of platinum recovered from automobile catalytic converters in the United States.'","'Production at a domestic mine continued but was constrained owing to operational challenges and flooding that took place in June 2022. Production of PGMs in South Africa, the worlds leading producer of PGM-containing mined material, decreased compared with that in 2021 owing to operational challenges at some mines, including disruptions to the supply of electricity, temporary closures of processing facilities, and scheduled maintenance of smelters. A slow economic recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shutdowns and declining capital investments also negatively affected production. Constrained automobile production owing to semiconductor chip shortages, declining diesel passenger vehicle production, inflation, and slow economic growth are expected to result in decreased demand for palladium, platinum, and rhodium used in catalytic converters. Demand could be offset, however, by the development of PGM-based proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (also known as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells) used in hydrogen storage and transportation technologies. The estimated annual average price of ruthenium in 2022 increased by 4% compared with that in 2021, whereas the estimated prices for rhodium, platinum, palladium, and iridium decreased by 16%, 10%, 9%, and 9%, respectively.'",'World resources of PGMs are estimated to total more than 100 million kilograms. The largest resources and reserves are in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa.',"'Palladium has been substituted for platinum in most gasoline-engine catalytic converters because of the historically lower price for palladium relative to that of platinum. About 25% of palladium can routinely be substituted for platinum in diesel catalytic converters; the proportion can be as much as 50% in some applications. For some industrial end uses, one PGM can substitute for another, but with losses in efficiency.'"
