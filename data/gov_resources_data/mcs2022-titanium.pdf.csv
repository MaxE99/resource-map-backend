MT,,2020,2021,2020,2021,"'Titanium sponge metal was produced by one operation in Utah. Production data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The facility in Salt Lake City, UT, with an estimated capacity of 500 tons per year, produced titanium that was further refined for use in electronics. A second sponge facility in Henderson, NV, with an estimated capacity of 12,600 tons per year, was idled since 2020 owing to market conditions. A third facility, in Rowley, UT, with an estimated capacity of 10,900 tons per year, has remained on care- and-maintenance status since 2016. Although detailed 2021 consumption data were withheld to avoid disclosing proprietary data, the majority of titanium metal was used in aerospace applications, and the remainder was used in armor, chemical processing, marine hardware, medical implants, power generation, consumer, and other applications. The value of imported sponge was about $140 million, a significant decrease compared with $173 million in 2020. In 2021, titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment production, by four companies operating five facilities in four States, was valued at about $3.2 billion. The estimated end-use distribution of TiO2 pigment consumption was paints (including lacquers and varnishes), 60%; plastics, 20%; paper, 5%; and other, 15%. Other uses of TiO2 included catalysts, ceramics, coated fabrics and textiles, floor coverings, printing ink, and roofing granules.'","'Owing to limited responses from voluntary surveys, consumption of titanium scrap metal was withheld for the titanium metal industry. Consumption data for the steel, superalloy, other industries were not available.'","'The 500-ton-per-year Salt Lake City, UT, plant was the only active domestic producer of titanium sponge, and the Salt Lake City operations primarily supported the production of electronic-grade materials. Consequently, U.S. producers of titanium ingot and downstream products were reliant on imports of titanium sponge and scrap. Reduced demand from the aerospace and other industries resulted in a 27% decrease in imports of titanium sponge compared with those in 2020. Japan (92%) and Kazakhstan (6%) were the leading import sources for titanium sponge in 2021. U.S. imports of titanium waste and scrap were about 11,000 tons. Germany (20%), the United Kingdom (15%), Canada (13%), France (10%), and Japan (8%) were the leading import sources for titanium waste and scrap in 2021. The duty-paid unit value of scrap imports was about $4.70 per kilogram. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) led investigations under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that determined titanium sponge imports into the United States threatened to impair national security. The investigation concluded that the United States was at risk of losing the remaining industrial capacity and technical knowledge related to titanium sponge production that is essential to meet national defense and critical infrastructure requirements. In October, the DOC published its findings and recommendations from the investigation in the Federal Register (86 FR 59115). Changes to existing tariff rates for titanium sponge were not recommended. Domestic production of TiO2 pigment in 2021 was estimated to be about 1.1 million tons. Although heavily reliant on imports of titanium mineral concentrates, the United States was a net exporter of TiO2 pigments. After a multiyear low in 2020, exports of titanium pigments increased significantly in 2021. Chinas TiO2 pigment production was estimated to be 3.7 million tons.'",'Reserves and resources of titanium minerals are discussed in the Titanium Mineral Concentrates chapter.',"'Few materials possess titanium metals strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. In high- strength applications, titanium competes with aluminum, composites, intermetallics, steel, and superalloys. Aluminum, nickel, specialty steels, and zirconium alloys may be substituted for titanium for applications that require corrosion resistance. Ground calcium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate, kaolin, and talc compete with titanium dioxide as a white pigment.'"
