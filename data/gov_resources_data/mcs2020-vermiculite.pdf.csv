1000 MT,,2018.0,2019.0,2019.0,"'Two companies with mining and processing facilities in South Carolina and Virginia produced approximately 200,000 tons of vermiculite concentrate, but actual data have been rounded to one significant digit to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Flakes of raw vermiculite concentrate are micaceous in appearance and contain interlayer water in their structure. When the flakes are heated rapidly at a temperature above 870 C, the water flashes into steam, and the flakes expand into accordionlike particles. This process is called exfoliation or expansion, and the resulting lightweight material is chemically inert, fire resistant, and odorless. Most of the vermiculite concentrate produced in the United States was shipped to 17 exfoliating plants in 11 States. The end uses for exfoliated vermiculite were estimated to be agriculture and horticulture, 46%; lightweight concrete aggregates (including cement premixes, concrete, and plaster), 17%; insulation, 10%; and other, 27%.'",'Insignificant.',"'U.S. exports and imports of vermiculite are not collected as a separate category by the U.S. Census Bureau. However, United States imports were estimated to be about 32,000 tons in 2019, almost 14% less than those of 2018. Coarse-grade vermiculite remained in short supply; however, prices were unchanged in 2019. Most imports came from South Africa and Brazil in 2019. Expansion at the 30,000-ton-per-year Namekara Mine in Uganda continued toward its goal of 80,000 tons per year of production. The deposit was considered to be one of the worlds largest vermiculite deposits with significant portions of medium- and coarse-grade material. The Namekara deposit has enough resources for more than 50 years of production at previously announced rates. A company in Brazil continued to expand production capacity at its vermiculite mine in central Brazil and continued with the development of another deposit near Brasilia to bring the companys total production capacity to 200,000 tons per year. Companies in China with significant vermiculite resources also were ramping up production, although processing operations continued to be somewhat constrained by increased enforcement of environmental regulations. Specific production data were not available for China. Exploration and development of vermiculite deposits containing medium, large, and premium (coarser) grades (mostly in China and South Africa) are likely to continue because of the higher demand for those grades. Finer grade production has exceeded consumption for several years. However, coarser grade (greater than 5-millimeter particle size) production has not been able to keep up with demand. Producers will continue to investigate ways to increase the use of the finer grades in existing products and in uses that require coarse material. Innovative applications continue to emerge, including the use of vermiculite to combat air pollution and absorb water in mines, replacing zeolites in ion-exchange columns, purifying wastewater, and containing or removing nuclear waste. '","'In addition to the producing mines in South Carolina and Virginia, there are vermiculite occurrences in Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming which contain estimated resources of 2 million to 3 million tons. Significant deposits have been reported in Australia, China, Russia, Uganda, and some other countries, but reserves and resource information comes from many sources and, in most cases, it is not clear whether the numbers refer to vermiculite alone or vermiculite plus other minerals and host rock and overburden.'",''
