MT,,2019,2020,"One company in Utah mined bertrandite ore and converted it, along with imported beryl, into beryllium hydroxide. Some of the beryllium hydroxide was shipped to the companys plant in Ohio, where it was converted into metal, oxide, and downstream beryllium-copper master alloy, and some was sold. Based on the estimated unit value for beryllium in imported beryllium-copper master alloy, beryllium apparent consumption of 170 tons was valued at about $110 million. Based on sales revenues, approximately 24% of beryllium products were used in aerospace and defense applications; 23% in industrial components; 12% each in automotive electronics and telecommunications infrastructure; 11% in consumer electronics; 9% in energy applications; 1% in semiconductor applications; and 8% in other applications. Beryllium alloy strip and bulk products, the most common forms of processed beryllium, were used in all application areas. Most unalloyed beryllium metal and beryllium composite products were used in defense and scientific applications.","Beryllium was recovered from new scrap generated during the manufacture of beryllium products and from old scrap. Detailed data on the quantities of beryllium recycled are not available but may account for as much as 20% to 25% of total beryllium consumption. The leading U.S. beryllium producer established a comprehensive recycling program for all of its beryllium products, recovering approximately 40% of the beryllium content of the new and old beryllium alloy scrap.","Domestic beryllium consumption in 2020 was estimated to be about 6% lower than that of 2019. Imports of beryl concentrate have decreased substantially since 2015. During the first 6 months of 2020, the leading U.S. beryllium producer reported that net sales of its beryllium alloy strip and bulk products and beryllium metal and composite products were 24% lower than those during the first 6 months of 2019. Value-added sales of beryllium products decreased primarily in the aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, energy, and telecommunications markets. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was reported to have been a substantial factor in the reduction of customer demand. Because of the toxic nature of beryllium, various international, national, and State guidelines and regulations have been established regarding beryllium in air, water, and other media. Industry is required to carefully control the quantity of beryllium dust, fumes, and mists in the workplace.","The worlds identified resources of beryllium have been estimated to be more than 100,000 tons. About 60% of these resources are in the United States; by tonnage, the Spor Mountain area in Utah, the McCullough Butte area in Nevada, the Black Hills area in South Dakota, the Sierra Blanca area in Texas, the Seward Peninsula in Alaska, and the Gold Hill area in Utah account for most of the total","Because the cost of beryllium is high compared with that of other materials, it is used in applications in which its properties are crucial. In some applications, certain metal matrix or organic composites, high-strength grades of aluminum, pyrolytic graphite, silicon carbide, steel, or titanium may be substituted for beryllium metal or beryllium composites. Copper alloys containing nickel and silicon, tin, titanium, or other alloying elements or phosphor bronze alloys (copper-tin-phosphorus) may be substituted for beryllium-copper alloys, but these substitutions can result in substantially reduced performance. Aluminum nitride or boron nitride may be substituted for beryllium oxide."
