MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,"'In 2021, domestic gold mine production was estimated to be 180 tons, 7% less than that in 2020, and the value was estimated to be about $10 billion. Gold was produced at more than 40 lode mines in 11 States, at several large placer mines in Alaska, and at numerous smaller placer mines (mostly in Alaska and in the Western States). Nevada was the leading gold-producing State, accounting for about 74% of total domestic production. About 6% of domestic gold was recovered as a byproduct of processing domestic base-metal ores, chiefly copper ores. The top 26 operations yielded about 98% of the mined gold produced in the United States. Commercial- grade gold was produced at about 15 refineries. A few dozen companies, out of several thousand companies and artisans, dominated the fabrication of gold into commercial products. U.S. jewelry manufacturing was heavily concentrated in the New York, NY, and Providence, RI, areas, with lesser concentrations in California, Florida, and Texas. Estimated global gold consumption was jewelry, 47%; physical bar, 21%; central banks and other institutions, 14%; official coins and medals and imitation coins, 10%; electrical and electronics, 7%; and other, 1%.'","'In 2021, an estimated 90 tons of new and old scrap was recycled, equivalent to about 36% of reported consumption. The domestic supply of gold from recycling decreased slightly compared with that of 2020.'","'The estimated gold price in 2021 was slightly higher than the previous record-high annual price in 2020.The Engelhard daily price of gold in 2021 fluctuated in the first and second quarters. Early in the year, the gold price was about $1,840 per troy ounce before decreasing in March and increasing through May. Several factors were reported to have caused the increase in price: gold demand for safe-haven buying increased owing to the continued global COVID-19 pandemic, global investor uncertainty, and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board low interest rates. The price decreased slightly from June through October and then increased in November. In 2021, worldwide gold mine production was estimated to be slightly less than that in 2020. Decreased gold mine production in Papua New Guinea, Russia, and the United States more than offset production increases in China, Ghana, Indonesia, South Africa, and Tanzania.In the first 9 months of 2021, global consumption of gold in physical bars increased by about 58%, in jewelry by 49%, in industrial applications by 16%, in electronics by about 13%, and in official coins and medals and imitation coins by about 6% compared with that in the first 9 months of 2020. Global investments in gold-based exchange-traded funds decreased by almost 116%, while gold holdings in central banks doubled during the same period. '","""An assessment of U.S. gold resources indicated 33,000 tons of gold in identified (15,000 tons) and undiscovered (18,000 tons) resources.'! Nearly one-quarter of the gold in undiscovered resources was estimated to be contained in porphyry copper deposits. The gold resources in the United States, however, are only a small portion of global gold resources.""","'Base metals clad with gold alloys are widely used to economize on gold in electrical and electronic products and in jewelry; many of these products are continually redesigned to maintain high-utility standards with lower gold content. Generally, palladium, platinum, and silver may substitute for gold.'"
