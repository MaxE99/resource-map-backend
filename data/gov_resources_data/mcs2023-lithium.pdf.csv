MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'Commercial-scale lithium production in the United States was from one continental brine operation in Nevada. Lithium was also commercially produced from the brine-sourced waste tailings of a Utah- based magnesium producer. Two companies produced a wide range of downstream lithium compounds in the United States from domestic or imported lithium carbonate, lithium chloride, and lithium hydroxide. Domestic production data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Although lithium markets vary by location, global end-use markets were estimated as follows: batteries, 80%; ceramics and glass, 7%; lubricating greases, 4%; continuous casting mold flux powders, 2%; air treatment, 1%; medical, 1%; and other uses, 5%. Lithium consumption for batteries increased significantly in recent years because rechargeable lithium batteries have been used extensively in the growing market for electric vehicles and portable electronic devices, and increasingly have been used in electric tools, and grid storage applications. Lithium minerals were used directly as ore concentrates in ceramics and glass applications. '","'Construction of lithium battery recycling plants increased at a rapid pace. As of November 2022, about 44 companies in Canada and the United States and 47 companies in Europe recycled lithium batteries or planned to do so. Automobile companies and battery recyclers partnered to supply the automobile industry with a source of battery materials.'","'Excluding U.S. production, worldwide lithium production in 2022 increased by 21% to approximately 130,000 tons from 107,000 tons in 2021 in response to strong demand from the lithium-ion battery market and increased prices of lithium. Global consumption of lithium in 2022 was estimated to be 134,000 tons, a 41% increase from 95,000 tons in 2021. Spot lithium carbonate prices in China (cost, insurance, and freight [c.i.f.]) increased from approximately $35,000 per ton in January to about $67,000 per ton in November. For fixed contracts, the annual average U.S. lithium carbonate price was $37,000 per ton in 2022, almost three times higher than that in 2021. Spot lithium hydroxide prices in China (free on board) increased from approximately $35,300 per ton in January to about $78,000 per ton in November. Spot spodumene (6% lithium oxide) prices in China (c.i.f.) increased from approximately $4,900 per ton in January to about $5,800 per ton in November. Six mineral operations in Australia, one mineral tailings operation in Brazil, two brine operations each in Argentina and Chile, and three mineral and two brine operations in China accounted for the majority of world lithium production. Additionally, smaller operations in Brazil, Canada, China, Portugal, the United States, and Zimbabwe also contributed to world lithium production. Owing to the rapid increase in demand and prices of lithium in 2022, established lithium operations worldwide increased or were in the process of increasing production capacity. The U.S. Department of Energy selected 12 lithium-based projects funded with $1.6 billion from the 2022 U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support new commercial-scale domestic facilities to extract and process lithium, manufacture battery components, recycle batteries, and develop new technologies to increase U.S. lithium reserves. Lithium supply security has become a top priority for technology companies in Asia, Europe, and North America. Strategic alliances and joint ventures among technology companies and exploration companies continued to be established to ensure a reliable, diversified supply of lithium for battery suppliers and vehicle manufacturers. Brine- based lithium sources were in various stages of development or exploration in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, China, and the United States; mineral-based lithium sources were in various stages of development or exploration in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Congo (Kinshasa), Czechia, Ethiopia, Finland, Germany, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, the United States, and Zimbabwe; lithium-clay sources were in various stages of development or exploration in Mexico and the United States.'","'Owing to continuing exploration, identified lithium resources have increased substantially worldwide and total about 98 million tons. Identified lithium resources in the United Statesfrom continental brines, claystone, geothermal brines, hectorite, oilfield brines, and pegmatitesare 12 million tons. Identified lithium resources in other countries have been revised to 86 million tons. Identified lithium resources are distributed as follows: Bolivia, 21 million tons; Argentina, 20 million tons; Chile, 11 million tons; Australia, 7.9 million tons; China, 6.8 million tons; Germany, 3.2 million tons; Congo (Kinshasa), 3 million tons; Canada, 2.9 million tons; Mexico, 1.7 million tons; Czechia, 1.3 million tons; Serbia, 1.2 million tons; Russia, 1 million tons; Peru, 880,000 tons; Mali, 840,000 tons; Brazil, 730,000 tons; Zimbabwe, 690,000 tons; Spain, 320,000 tons; Portugal, 270,000 tons; Namibia; 230,000 tons; Ghana, 180,000 tons; Finland, 68,000 tons; Austria, 60,000 tons; and Kazakhstan, 50,000 tons.'","'Substitution for lithium compounds is possible in batteries, ceramics, greases, and manufactured glass. Examples are calcium, magnesium, mercury, and zinc as anode material in primary batteries; calcium and aluminum soaps as substitutes for stearates in greases; and sodic and potassic fluxes in ceramics and glass manufacture.'"
