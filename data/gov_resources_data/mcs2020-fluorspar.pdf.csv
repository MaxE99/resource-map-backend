1000 MT,,2018.0,2019.0,2019.0,"'In 2019, minimal fluorspar (calcium fluoride, CaF2) was produced in the United States. One company sold fluorspar from stockpiles produced as a byproduct of its limestone quarrying operation in Cave-in-Rock, IL. Synthetic fluorspar may have been recovered as a byproduct of petroleum alkylation, stainless steel pickling, or uranium processing, but no data were collected from any of these operations. An estimated 17,000 tons of fluorosilicic acid (FSA), equivalent to about 27,000 tons of fluorspar grading 100%, was recovered from four phosphoric acid plants processing phosphate rock. Fluorosilicic acid was used primarily in water fluoridation. U.S. fluorspar consumption was satisfied by imports and small quantities of byproduct synthetic fluorspar. Domestically, production of hydrofluoric acid (HF) in Louisiana and Texas was by far the leading use for acid-grade fluorspar. Hydrofluoric acid is the primary feedstock for the manufacture of virtually all fluorine-bearing chemicals, particularly refrigerants and fluoropolymers, and is also a key ingredient in the processing of aluminum and uranium. Fluorspar was also used in cement production, in enamels, as a flux in steelmaking, in glass manufacture, in iron and steel casting, and in welding rod coatings. '","'Synthetic fluorspar may be produced from neutralization of waste in the enrichment of uranium, petroleum alkylation, and stainless steel pickling; however, undesirable impurities constrain use. Primary aluminum producers recycle HF and fluorides from smelting operations.'","'In recent years, several of the worlds leading mines have been operating at or near full capacity. Further, there have been increasing concerns about the possibility of China becoming a net fluorspar importer owing to increased environmental regulation of its mining industry. Although there is little reliable information on Chinas fluorspar production, Chinas reported imports of fluorspar increased by approximately 350,000 tons from 2017 to 2018, and by an estimated 100,000 tons in 2019; imports were primarily from Mongolia and new production in Burma. New producers in Canada, Morocco, and South Africa were also ramping up production in 2019. A hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) plant in Corpus Christi, TX, went into operation in February. HFO manufacturers continued to introduce HFOs and blends as low global-warming-potential alternatives to hydrofluorocarbon-based foam-blowing agents, propellants, and refrigerants, which are subject to increased restrictions under the Montreal Protocol. Because refrigerant gases are a leading downstream use of HF, the HFO plant, along with a similar plant in Baton Rouge, LA, that went into operation in 2017, were expected to support strong demand for fluorspar in the United States.'","'Enormous quantities of fluorine are present in phosphate rock. Current U.S. reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 1 billion tons, containing about 72 million tons of 100% fluorspar equivalent assuming an average fluorine content of 3.5% in the phosphate rock. World reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 70 billion tons, equivalent to about 5 billion tons of 100% fluorspar equivalent.'","""Fluorosilicic acid is used to produce aluminum fluoride (AIF3), but because of differing physical properties, AIFs produced from FSA is not readily substituted for AIFs produced from fluorspar. Fluorosilicic acid has been used to produce HF, but this practice has not been widely adopted. Synthetic fluorspar could potentially be recovered by the Department of Energy's two depleted uranium hexafluoride conversion plants in Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH. However, the preferred product is currently aqueous HF rather than fluorspar. Aluminum smelting dross, borax, calcium chloride, iron oxides, manganese ore, silica sand, and titanium dioxide have been used as substitutes for fluorspar fluxes."""
