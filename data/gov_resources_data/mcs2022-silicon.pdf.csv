1000 MT,,2020,2021,"Six companies produced silicon materials in 2021, all east of the Mississippi River. Most ferrosilicon was consumed in the ferrous foundry and steel industries, predominantly in the Eastern United States, and was sourced primarily from domestic quartzite (silica). The main consumers of silicon metal were producers of aluminum alloys and the chemical industry, in particular for the manufacture of silicones. The semiconductor and solar energy industries, which manufacture chips for computers and photovoltaic cells from high- purity silicon, respectively, also consumed silicon metal.",Insignificant.,"Combined domestic ferrosilicon and silicon metal production in 2021, expressed in terms of contained silicon, increased from that in 2020. One producer reopened its ferrosilicon production facility in March 2021 owing to increased demand for ferrosilicon products and improved domestic pricing. The facility had closed in July 2020 owing to decreased demand and lower pricesin part because of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as competition from lower priced imported ferrosilicon. Domestic production during the first 8 months of 2021 was about 5% more, on a silicon-content basis, than that during the same period in 2020. By August 2021, average U.S. spot market prices increased by almost 9% for 50%-grade ferrosilicon and by almost 60% for 75%-grade ferrosilicon compared with the annual averages in 2020; the average silicon metal spot market price increased by almost 50% compared with the annual average spot price in 2020. Excluding the United States, ferrosilicon accounted for almost 70% of world silicon production on a silicon-content basis in 2021. The leading countries for ferrosilicon production were, in descending order and on a silicon-content basis, China, Russia, and Norway. For silicon metal, the leading producers were China, Brazil, and Norway. China accounted for approximately 70% of total global estimated production of silicon materials in 2021. Global production of silicon materials, on a silicon-content basis, was estimated to be about 5% more than that in 2020. Global production of steel, the leading use of ferrosilicon, increased in 2021 compared with production in 2020 owing to increased demand following the negative effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic.","World and domestic resources for making silicon metal and alloys are abundant and, in most producing countries, adequate to supply world requirements for many decades. The source of the silicon is silica in various natural forms, such as quartzite.","Aluminum, silicon carbide, and silicomanganese can be substituted for ferrosilicon in some applications. Gallium arsenide and germanium are the principal substitutes for silicon in semiconductor and infrared applications."
