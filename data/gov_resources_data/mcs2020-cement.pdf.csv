1000 MT,,2018,2019,2019,2019,"'In 2019, U.S. portland cement production increased by 2.5% to 86 million tons, and masonry cement production continued to remain steady at 2.4 million tons. Cement was produced at 96 plants in 34 States, and at 2 plants in Puerto Rico. U.S. cement production continued to be limited by closed or idle plants, underutilized capacity at others, production disruptions from plant upgrades, and relatively inexpensive imports. In 2019, sales of cement increased slightly and were valued at $12.5 billion. Most cement sales were to make concrete, worth at least $65 billion. In 2019, it was estimated that 70% to 75% of sales were to ready-mixed concrete producers, 10% to concrete product manufactures, 8% to 10% to contractors, and 5% to 12% to other customer types. Texas, California, Missouri, Florida, Alabama, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were, in descending order of production, the seven leading cement-producing States and accounted for nearly 60% of U.S. production.'","'Cement is not recycled, but significant quantities of concrete are recycled for use as a construction aggregate. Cement kilns can use waste fuels, recycled cement kiln dust, and recycled raw materials such as slags and fly ash. Various secondary materials can be incorporated as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in blended cements and in the cement paste in concrete.'","'Construction spending decreased in 2019, owing to a decline in private residential and nonresidential spending. Cement shipments into North Carolina and South Carolina increased owing to reconstruction following a hurricane in 2018. The leading cement-consuming States were Texas, California, and Florida, in descending order by tonnage. No new company mergers were reported in 2019, but one European cement company entered into an agreement to purchase a Mexican cement companys plant in Pennsylvania, pending regulatory approval. No major cement plant upgrades were completed during the year, but several minor upgrades were ongoing at a few domestic plants. One cement company began work on an upgrade to one of its plants in Indiana, with completion expected in 2022. Another company continued to work on securing permits for a new white cement plant in Texas, which would be the third white cement plant in the country. Many plants have installed emissions-reduction equipment to comply with the 2010 National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). It remains possible that some kilns could be shut, idled, or used in a reduced capacity to comply with NESHAP, which would constrain U.S. clinker capacity.'","'Although reserves at individual plants are subject to exhaustion, limestone and other cement raw materials are geologically widespread and abundant, and overall shortages are unlikely in the future.'","'Most portland cement is used to make concrete, mortars, or stuccos, and competes in the construction sector with concrete substitutes, such as aluminum, asphalt, clay brick, fiberglass, glass, gypsum (plaster), steel, stone, and wood. Certain materials, especially fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag, develop good hydraulic cementitious properties by reacting with lime, such as that released by the hydration of portland cement. Where readily available (including as imports), these SCMs are increasingly being used as partial substitutes for portland cement in many concrete applications and are components of finished blended cements.'"
