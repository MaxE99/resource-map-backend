1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'U.S. feldspar production in 2022 had an estimated value of $45 million. Feldspar was produced by seven companies in California, Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Virginia. Feldspar processors reported joint product recovery of mica and silica sand. One company produced nepheline syenite in the United States as a flux, but production data were not available. Feldspar is ground to about 20 mesh for glassmaking and to 200 mesh or finer for most ceramic and filler applications. It was estimated that domestically produced feldspar was transported by ship, rail, or truck to at least 30 States and to foreign destinations, including Canada and Mexico. In pottery and glass, feldspar and nepheline syenite function as a flux. Glass manufacturing accounted for an estimated 47% of the 2022 end-use distribution of domestic feldspar and nepheline, and ceramic tile, pottery, and other uses, accounted for the remaining 53%. '","'Feldspar and nepheline syenite are not recycled by producers; however, glass container producers use cullet (recycled container glass), thereby reducing feldspar and nepheline syenite consumption.'","'In 2022, estimated domestic production and sales of feldspar increased by about 24%, and the average unit value of sales was essentially unchanged compared with that in 2021. Estimated imports of feldspar increased by 60% compared with those in 2021, whereas nepheline syenite imports decreased by an estimated 5% in 2022 from those in 2021. Imports of nepheline syenite reported by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2018 were unusually high. In the United States, residential construction, in which feldspar is a raw material commonly used in the manufacture of plate glass, ceramic tiles and sanitaryware, and insulation, was unchanged during the first 10 months of 2022 compared with that in the same period in 2021. Glassincluding beverage containers (more than one-half of the feldspar consumed by the glass industry), plate glass, and fiberglass insulation for housing and building constructionaccounted for nearly one-half of all end uses of feldspar in the United States. Production and sales of feldspar were expected to increase into 2023, owing in part to an increase in demand for automotive glass manufacturing and for solar glass, used in the production of solar panels. A company based in Canada continued development of a feldspar-quartz-kaolin project in Idaho that contains high- grade potassium feldspar. Production was expected to be about 30,000 tons per year of potassium feldspar during a 25-year mine life. For several years, the operation has produced a feldspathic sand product with low-iron and low- trace-element concentrations from old mine tailings, which was sold to ceramic tile producers.'","'? Identified and undiscovered resources of feldspar are more than adequate to meet anticipated world demand. Quantitative data on resources of feldspar existing in feldspathic sands, granites, and pegmatites generally have not been compiled. Ample geologic evidence indicates that resources are large, although not always conveniently accessible to the principal centers of consumption.'","'Imported nepheline syenite was the major alternative material for feldspar. Feldspar can be replaced in some of its end uses by clays, electric furnace slag, feldspar-silica mixtures, pyrophyllite, soodumene, or talc.'"
