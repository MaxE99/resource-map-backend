MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'U.S. mine production of molybdenum in 2021 decreased by 6% to an estimated 48,000 tons compared with that in the previous year. Molybdenum ore was produced as a primary product at two minesboth in Coloradowhereas seven copper mines (four in Arizona and one each in Montana, Nevada, and Utah) recovered molybdenite concentrate as a byproduct. Three roasting plants converted molybdenite concentrate to molybdic oxide, from which intermediate products, such as ferromolybdenum, metal powder, and various chemicals, were produced. Metallurgical applications accounted for more than 88% of the total molybdenum consumed.'","'Molybdenum is recycled as a component of catalysts, ferrous scrap, and superalloy scrap. Ferrous scrap consists of revert, new, and old scrap. Revert scrap refers to remnants manufactured in the steelmaking process. New scrap is generated by steel mill customers and recycled by scrap collectors and processors. Old scrap is largely molybdenum-bearing alloys recycled after serving their useful life. The amount of molybdenum recycled as part of new and old steel and other scrap may be as much as 30% of the apparent supply of molybdenum. There are no processes for the separate recovery and refining of secondary molybdenum from its alloys. Molybdenum is not recovered separately from recycled steel and superalloys, but the molybdenum content of the recycled alloys is significant, and the molybdenum content is reused. Recycling of molybdenum-bearing scrap will continue to be dependent on the markets for the principal alloy metals in which molybdenum is contained, such as iron, nickel, and chromium.'","'In 2021, the estimated average molybdic oxide price increased by 81% compared with that in 2020, and U.S. estimated mine production of molybdenum decreased by 6% from that in 2020. The decrease in production was mainly the result of one byproduct mine in Utah decreasing its production by almost more than 70%. This decrease in production in Utah was offset by production increases at other molybdenum producers. Estimated U.S. imports for consumption increased by 18% compared with those in 2020. U.S. exports increased by 5% from those in 2020. Apparent consumption in 2021 was essentially unchanged compared with that in 2020. Global molybdenum production in 2021 increased slightly compared with that in 2020. In descending order of production, China, Chile, the United States, Peru, and Mexico provided 93% of total global production. Chinese molybdenum imports continued to be at historically high levels as China continued to focus on infrastructure growth to support its COVID-19 recovery. A major producer in China increased its molybdenum concentrate production in 2021 after having suspended its production for 6 months in 2020 following a tailings leakage accident. Many Chinese producers also continued to limit their molybdenum exports citing higher freight costs owing to container shortages and shipping delays. These factors all continued to contribute to decade-high molybdenum prices.'","'Identified resources of molybdenum in the United States are about 5.4 million tons, and in the rest of the world, about 20 million tons. Molybdenum occurs as the principal metal sulfide in large low-grade porphyry molybdenum deposits and as an associated metal sulfide in low-grade porphyry copper deposits. Resources of molybdenum are adequate to supply world needs for the foreseeable future.'","'There is little substitution for molybdenum in its major application in steels and cast irons. In fact, because of the availability and versatility of molybdenum, industry has sought to develop new materials that benefit from its alloying properties. Potential substitutes include boron, chromium, niobium (columbium), and vanadium in alloy steels; tungsten in tool steels; graphite, tantalum, and tungsten for refractory materials in high-temperature electric furnaces; and cadmium-red, chrome-orange, and organic-orange pigments for molybdenum orange.'"
