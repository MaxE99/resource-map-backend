MT,,2019,2020,"'The last U.S. producer of asbestos ceased operations in 2002 as a result of the decline in domestic and international asbestos markets associated with health and liability issues. The United States has since been wholly dependent on imports to meet manufacturing needs. All of the asbestos fiber currently imported into and used within the United States consists of chrysotile. In 2020, domestic consumption of chrysotile was estimated to be 450 tons, and all imports originated from Brazil, based on data available through July. The chloralkali industry, which uses chrysotile to manufacture nonreactive semipermeable diaphragms that prevent chlorine generated at the anode of an electrolytic cell from reacting with sodium hydroxide generated at the cathode, has accounted for 100% of asbestos consumption since at least 2016. In addition to chrysotile, a small, but unknown, quantity of asbestos is imported annually within manufactured products, including brake blocks for use in the oil industry, rubber sheets for gaskets used to create a chemical-containment seal in the production of titanium dioxide, certain other types of preformed gaskets, and some vehicle friction products.'",'None.',"'Consumption of asbestos fiber in the United States has decreased during the past several decades, falling from a record high of 803,000 tons in 1973 to less than 800 tons in each year since 2016. This decline has taken place as a result of health and liability issues associated with asbestos use, leading to the displacement of asbestos from traditional domestic markets by substitutes, alternative materials, and new technology. The chloralkali industry is the only remaining domestic consumer of asbestos in mineral form. Asbestos diaphragms are used in at least 11 chloralkali plants in the United States and account for about one-third of domestic chlorine production. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA), was signed into law in 2016. The legislation granted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) greater authority to evaluate the hazards posed by new chemicals as well as those already in the marketplace. In 2020, the EPA issued the final risk evaluation report for chrysotile. The agency determined that the disposal, processing, and (or) use of chrysotile in the chloralkali industry and in all chrysotile-containing manufactured products that are currently imported into the United States (oil industry brake blocks, sheet and other gaskets, and some vehicle friction products) present unreasonable risks to human health. As required by the TSCA, the EPA will propose and finalize actions to address these risks by yearend 2022. The new regulations could include limitations or prohibitions on the disposal, distribution in commerce, manufacture, processing, or use of chrysotile. Estimated worldwide consumption of asbestos fiber decreased from approximately 2 million tons in 2010 to roughly 1 million tons per year in the past several years. Asbestos-cement products, such as corrugated roofing tiles, pipes, and wall panels, are expected to continue to be the leading global market for asbestos. In Brazil, a comprehensive national ban on asbestos was enacted in November 2017. A judicial injunction allowed the only asbestos producer in the country to continue operating until February 2019, when production ceased. In July 2019, the government of the State of Goias passed a law that authorized the extraction of asbestos in the State for export purposes; ore processing was restarted in February 2020. The Supreme Federal Court of Brazil was expected to issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the Goias law but had not done so as of September 2020. At the former King Mine in Mashava, Zimbabwe, asbestos production from old tailings commenced in 2019, and dewatering of the mining shafts was completed in March 2020. The company was in the process of selling real estate assets to fund the restart of mining operations and working to dewater an additional asbestos mine in Zvishvane. At full capacity, the King Mine was expected to produce 75,000 tons per year of asbestos. '","' Reliable evaluations of global asbestos resources have not been published recently, and available information was insufficient to make accurate estimates for many countries. However, world resources are large and more than adequate to meet anticipated demand in the foreseeable future. Resources in the United States are composed mostly of short-fiber asbestos for which use in asbestos-based products is more limited than long-fiber asbestos.'","'Numerous materials substitute for asbestos. Substitutes include calcium silicate, carbon fiber, cellulose fiber, ceramic fiber, glass fiber, steel fiber, wollastonite, and several organic fibers, such as aramid, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene. Several nonfibrous minerals or rocks, such as perlite, serpentine, silica, and talc, are also considered to be possible asbestos substitutes for products in which the reinforcement properties of fibers are not required. Membrane cells and mercury cells are alternatives to asbestos diaphragms used in the chloralkali industry.'"
