1000 MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'In 2019, U.S. mine production of recoverable copper increased by 6% to an estimated 1.3 million tons and was valued at an estimated $7.9 billion, slightly less than $8.05 billion in 2018. Arizona was the leading copper-producing State and accounted for an estimated 68% of domestic output, followed by, in descending order, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Montana, Michigan, and Missouri. Twenty-four mines recovered copper, 15 of which accounted for 99% of production. Three smelters, 3 electrolytic refineries, 4 fire refineries, and 14 electrowinning facilities operated during 2019. Refined copper and scrap were used at about 30 brass mills, 15 rod mills, and 500 foundries and miscellaneous consumers. Copper and copper alloy products were used in building construction, 43%; electrical and electronic products, 20%; transportation equipment, 20%; consumer and general products, 10%; and industrial machinery and equipment, 7%.1'","'Old (post-consumer) scrap, converted to refined metal and alloys, provided an estimated 160,000 tons of copper, equivalent to 9% of apparent consumption. Purchased new (manufacturing) scrap, derived from fabricating operations, yielded an estimated 710,000 tons of copper. Of the total copper recovered from scrap (including aluminum- and nickel-base scrap), brass and wire-rod mills recovered approximately 80%; copper smelters, refiners, and ingot makers, 15%; and miscellaneous chemical plants, foundries, and manufacturers, 5%. Copper in all scrap contributed about 35% of the U.S. copper supply.'","'In 2019, U.S. mine production of copper increased by an estimated 6% owing to higher ore grades and (or) higher mining and milling rates at several operations. Output from the Mission Mine rose from that in 2018, when production was significantly affected by a landslide early in the year. On October 11, about 75% of unionized workers at a company with mines and plants in Arizona and Texas voted to go on strike. The company announced that it would temporarily close its smelter and refinery but did not address the status of its Arizona mines. Non-striking workers may have continued to extract ore at some sites, based on media reports. Production of refined copper in the United States fell by an estimated 7% as a result of the strike, which had not been resolved as of early December, and maintenance shutdowns at two other smelters. Two projects (Gunnison in Arizona and Pumpkin Hollow in Nevada) planned to begin production by yearend but had not started up as of the end of November. Estimated global mine production of copper decreased slightly to 20 million tons in 2019 from 20.4 million tons in 2018, owing primarily to reduced output from the Batu Hijau and Grasberg Mines in Indonesia, where mining was shifting to new ore zones. Production also declined in Chile as a result of lower ore grades, strikes, and weather-related disruptions. These decreases were partially offset by increased output from multiple other countries. Global refined production increased slightly to an estimated 25 million tons in 2019 from 24.4 million tons in 2018. Higher refinery capacity in China was mostly offset by smelter shutdowns for maintenance and upgrades in other countries. In Zambia, mined and refined copper output were affected by a new import duty on copper concentrates, which lowered smelter production and constrained the supply of sulfuric acid needed to produce electrowon copper.  Through November 2019, the monthly average COMEX spot copper price varied between $2.56 per pound (October) and $2.92 per pound (April). It was projected to average about $2.70 per pound for the full year, a decrease of 8% from $2.93 per pound in 2018.   '","'A 2014 U.S. Geological Survey assessment of copper deposits indicated that identified resources contained about 2.1 billion tons of copper, and undiscovered resources contained an estimated 3.5 billion tons.'","'Aluminum substitutes for copper in automobile radiators, cooling and refrigeration tube, electrical equipment, and power cable. Titanium and steel are used in heat exchangers. Optical fiber substitutes for copper in telecommunications applications, and plastics substitute for copper in drain pipe, plumbing fixtures, and water pipe.'"
