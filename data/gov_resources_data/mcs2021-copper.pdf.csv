Arizona was the leading copper-producing State and accounted for an estimated 74% of domestic output, followed by, in descending order, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Montana, Michigan, and Missouri. Copper was recovered or processed at 25 mines (18 of which accounted for 99% of mine production), 3 smelters, 3 electrolytic refineries, and 14 electrowinning facilities. Refined copper and scrap were used at about 30 brass mills, 15 rod mills, and 500 foundries and miscellaneous consumers. Copper and copper alloy products were used in building construction, 43%; electrical and electronic products, 21%; transportation equipment, 19%; consumer and general products, 10%; and industrial machinery and equipment, 7%.'","'Old (post-consumer) scrap, converted to refined metal and alloys, provided an estimated 150,000 tons of copper. Purchased new (manufacturing) scrap, derived from fabricating operations, yielded an estimated 720,000 tons. Of the total copper recovered from scrap (including non-copper-base scrap), brass and wire-rod mills accounted for about 80%; smelters, refiners, and ingot makers, 15%; and miscellaneous chemical plants, foundries, and manufacturers, 5%. Copper recovered from scrap contributed about 38% of the U.S. copper supply.'","'In 2020, U.S. mine production of copper decreased by an estimated 5%, primarily owing to reduced output from the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah and the Chino Mine in New Mexico. At Bingham Canyon, ore grades were lower than those in 2019 because of planned pit sequencing and optimization of molybdenum production during an extended shutdown of the smelter. In April, operations at the Chino Mine were suspended after multiple workers tested positive for COVID-19; the mine was expected to restart in 2021 at about 50% of capacity. Production at the Pumpkin Hollow Mine began in December 2019, was suspended in April 2020 owing to restrictions implemented by the State of Nevada in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and restarted in August. Output of refined copper in the United States decreased by an estimated 13% as a result of strikes, ongoing since October 2019, at a smelter in Arizona and electrolytic refinery in Texas. Refined copper production was also affected by maintenance at the smelter in Utah, which closed for several months for a complete furnace rebuild after an earthquake in March. Global mine production of copper declined slightly to an estimated 20 million tons in 2020 from 20.4 million tons in 2019, owing primarily to COVID-19 lockdowns in April and May. These disruptions significantly affected output in Peru, the second-ranked mine producer of copper, where production through July 2020 fell by nearly 250,000 tons (23%) from that in the same period of 2019. Global refined copper production increased slightly to an estimated 25 million tons in 2020 from 24.5 million tons in 2019, when output in multiple countries was affected by temporary smelter shutdowns for maintenance and upgrades.'","' A U.S. Geological Survey study of global copper deposits indicated that, as of 2015, identified resources contained 2.1 billion tons of copper, and undiscovered resources contained an estimated 3.5 billion tons.9'","'Aluminum substitutes for copper in automobile radiators, cooling and refrigeration tube, electrical equipment, and power cable. Titanium and steel are used in heat exchangers. Optical fiber substitutes for copper in telecommunications applications, and plastics substitute for copper in drain pipe, plumbing fixtures, and water pipe.'"
