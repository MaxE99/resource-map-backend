1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'In 2022, the United States consumed an estimated 5% of world chromite ore production in various forms of imported materials, such as chromite ore, chromium chemicals, chromium ferroalloys, chromium metal, and stainless steel. Imported chromite ore was consumed by one chemical company to produce chromium chemicals. Stainless-steel and heat-resisting-steel producers were the leading consumers of ferrochromium. Stainless steels and superalloys require the addition of chromium via ferrochromium or chromium- containing scrap. The value of chromium material consumption was expected to be about $1.5 billion in 2022, as measured by the value of net imports, excluding stainless steel, which was a 75% increase from $874 million in 2021.'","'In 2022, recycled chromium (contained in reported stainless-steel scrap receipts) accounted for 17% of apparent consumption.'","'South Africa was the leading chromite ore producer. Global chromite ore mine production was estimated to have decreased slightly in 2022, owing to constraints from operational challenges in some countries, slow global economic growth, and increasing labor costs. China was the leading ferrochromium- and stainless-steel-producing country and the leading chromium-consuming country. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related lockdowns, tight financial conditions, and a decrease in demand could affect ferrochromium and stainless-steel production in China. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided funding for a critical minerals mapping project, which includes chromium, that the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Mapping Resources Initiative will undertake. From September 2021 to September 2022, the monthly average high-carbon ferrochromium price increased by 85%. The price of chromium metal increased by 36% in September 2022 compared with the monthly average price in September 2021. '","'*World resources are greater than 12 billion tons of shipping-grade chromite, sufficient to meet conceivable demand for centuries. World chromium resources are heavily geographically concentrated (95%) in Kazakhstan and southern Africa; United States chromium resources are mostly in the Stillwater Complex in Montana.'","'Chromium has no substitute in stainless steel, the leading end use, or in superalloys, the major strategic end use. Chromium-containing scrap can substitute for ferrochromium in some metallurgical uses.'"
