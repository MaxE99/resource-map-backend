1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'In 2022, phosphate rock ore was mined by five companies at nine mines in four States and processed into an estimated 21 million tons of marketable product, valued at $1.9 billion, free on board (f.o.b.) mine. Florida and North Carolina accounted for more than 75% of total domestic output; the remainder was produced in Idaho and Utah. Marketable product refers to beneficiated phosphate rock with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) content suitable for phosphoric acid or elemental phosphorus production. More than 95% of the phosphate rock mined in the United States was used to manufacture wet-process phosphoric acid and superphosphoric acid, which were used as intermediate feedstocks in the manufacture of granular and liquid ammonium phosphate fertilizers and animal feed supplements. About 25% of the wet-process phosphoric acid produced was exported in the form of upgraded granular diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer and merchant-grade phosphoric acid. The balance of the phosphate rock mined was for the manufacture of elemental phosphorus, which was used to produce phosphorus compounds for industrial applications, primarily glyphosate herbicide. '",'None.',"'Domestic production and consumption of phosphate rock were lower in 2022, owing to slightly lower production of elemental phosphorus and phosphoric acid. Domestic fertilizer production and consumption also were lower because of adverse weather conditions in some areas of the United States during the spring planting season, rail delays, high fertilizer costs, and hurricane damage to some production facilities. In Idaho, all three producers continued to develop new mines that will replace existing mines within the next decade. World production of phosphate rock was estimated to have been slightly lower in 2022. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine caused some reduction of exports of phosphate rock and fertilizers from Russia. Although fertilizer materials were exempt from sanctions, some countries did not allow Russian ships in their ports. In 2022, the global phosphate fertilizer market experienced supply disruptions, high fertilizer prices in the first half of the year, and lower consumption in some regions. The most significant supply disruption was from China placing restrictions on exports of DAP and MAP. This reduced Chinese exports by about 5 million tons. Other countries increased exports but were unable to compensate for the loss to the world market. Global consumption of P2O5 contained in fertilizers was estimated to have decreased slightly to about 48 million tons in 2022. '","'Some world reserves were reported only in terms of ore tonnage and grade. Phosphate rock resources occur principally as sedimentary marine phosphorites. The largest sedimentary deposits are found in northern Africa, the Middle East, China, and the United States. Significant igneous occurrences are found in Brazil, Canada, Finland, Russia, and South Africa. Large phosphate resources have been identified on the continental shelves and on seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. World resources of phosphate rock are more than 300 billion tons. There are no imminent shortages of phosphate rock.'",'There are no substitutes for phosphorus in agriculture.'
