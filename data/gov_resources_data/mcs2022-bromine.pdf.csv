MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'Bromine was recovered from underground brines by two companies in Arkansas. Bromine is one of the leading mineral commodities, in terms of value, produced in Arkansas. The two bromine companies in the United States account for a large percentage of world production capacity. The leading global applications of bromine are for the production of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and clear brine drilling fluids. Bromine compounds are also used in a variety of other applications, including industrial uses, as intermediates, and for water treatment. U.S. apparent consumption of bromine in 2021 was estimated to be greater than that in 2020. '","'Some bromide solutions were recycled to obtain elemental bromine and to prevent the solutions from being disposed of as hazardous waste. For example, hydrogen bromide is emitted as a byproduct in many organic reactions. This byproduct waste can be recycled with virgin bromine brines and used as a source of bromine production. Bromine contained in plastics can be incinerated as solid organic waste and the bromine can be recovered.'","'The United States maintained its position as one of the leading bromine producers in the world along with China, Israel, and Jordan. In 2021, the leading source of imports of bromine and bromide compounds (gross weight) was Israel. The average import value of bromine and bromine compounds decreased by about 3% in 2021 compared with that in 2020. Together, the leading imported bromine products in terms of both gross weight and bromine content were bromides and bromide oxides of ammonium, calcium, or zinc and bromides of sodium or potassium (over 90%). Total imports of bromine and bromine compounds (bromine content) increased by about 10% whereas total exports decreased by about 30% compared with that in 2020. Global sales of bromine and bromine compounds increased in 2021 compared with those in 2020. Sales volumes increased for BFRs and clear brine fluids, the leading applications of bromine, compared with the previous year. Sales were driven, in particular, by strong demand in electronic, automotive, and construction industries, the leading consumers of BFRs. Although sales of clear brine drilling fluids increased compared with the previous year, demand had yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. In February 2021, Texas suffered a major power crisis, which resulted from three severe winter storms sweeping across the United States on February 1011, 1317, and 1520. The storms caused a massive electricity generation failure in Texas, leading to shortages of water, food, and heat. Additionally, the winter storms adversely affected drilling production, drew down inventory stocks, and disrupted supply-chain logistics. '","'Bromine is found principally in seawater, evaporitic (salt) lakes, and underground brines associated with petroleum deposits. The Dead Sea, in the Middle East, is estimated to contain 1 billion tons of bromine. Seawater contains about 65 parts per million bromine, or an estimated 100 trillion tons. Bromine is also recovered from seawater as a coproduct during evaporation to produce salt.'","'Chlorine and iodine may be substituted for bromine in a few chemical reactions and for sanitation purposes. There are no comparable substitutes for bromine in various oil- and gas-well-completion and packer applications. Because plastics have a low ignition temperature, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, organic chlorine compounds, and phosphorus compounds can be substituted for bromine as fire retardants in some uses.'"
