## ResourceMap - Visualizing Global Economic Data

ResourceMap was created to visualize the trading of resources worldwide. Our aim is to display where essential resources for the global economy are produced and where reserves are located. Additionally, we provide users with insights into how certain economies rely on these resource exports, enhancing their understanding of global trade balances.
