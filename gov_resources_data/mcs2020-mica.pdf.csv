MT,,2018,2019,2019,2018,2019,2019,"'Scrap and flake mica production, excluding low-quality sericite, was estimated to be 38,000 tons valued at $4.6 million. Mica was mined in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Dakota. Scrap mica was recovered principally from mica and sericite schist and as a byproduct from feldspar, industrial sand beneficiation, and kaolin. Eight companies produced an estimated 63,000 tons of ground mica valued at about $22 million from domestic and imported scrap and flake mica. The majority of domestic production was processed into small-particle- size mica by either wet or dry grinding. Primary uses were joint compound, oil-well-drilling additives, paint, roofing, and rubber products. A minor amount of sheet mica was produced as incidental production from feldspar mining in North Carolina. Data was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The domestic consuming industry was dependent on imports to meet demand for sheet mica. Most sheet mica was fabricated into parts for electrical and electronic equipment. '",'None.',"'Domestic production of scrap and flake mica was estimated to have decreased by 14% in 2019. Apparent consumption of scrap and flake mica decreased by 8%. Apparent consumption of sheet mica was estimated to have increased by 32% in 2019 as a result of increased imports of sheet mica from China. No environmental concerns are associated with the manufacture and use of mica products. Future supplies of sheet mica for United States consumption were expected to come increasingly from imports, primarily from Brazil, China, and India.'","'Resources of scrap and flake mica are available in clay deposits, granite, pegmatite, and schist, and are considered more than adequate to meet anticipated world demand in the foreseeable future. World resources of sheet mica have not been formally evaluated because of the sporadic occurrence of this material. Large deposits of mica-bearing rock are known to exist in countries such as Brazil, India, and Madagascar. Limited resources of sheet mica are available in the United States. Domestic resources are uneconomic because of the high cost of the hand labor required to mine and process sheet mica from pegmatites.'","'Some lightweight aggregates, such as diatomite, perlite, and vermiculite, may be substituted for ground mica when used as filler. Ground synthetic fluorophlogopite, a fluorine-rich mica, may replace natural ground mica for uses that require thermal and electrical properties of mica. Many materials can be substituted for mica in numerous electrical, electronic, and insulation uses. Substitutes include acrylic, cellulose acetate, fiberglass, fishpaper, nylatron, nylon, phenolics, polycarbonate, polyester, styrene, polyvinyl chloride, and vulcanized fiber. Mica paper made from scrap mica can be substituted for sheet mica in electrical and insulation applications.'"
