MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'In 2019, the nickel-copper Eagle Mine in Michigan produced cobalt-bearing nickel concentrate. In Missouri, a company built a flotation plant and produced nickel-copper-cobalt concentrate from historic mine tailings. Most U.S. cobalt supply comprised imports and secondary (scrap) materials. Approximately six companies in the United States produced cobalt chemicals. About 46% of the cobalt consumed in the United States was used in superalloys, mainly in aircraft gas turbine engines; 9% in cemented carbides for cutting and wear- resistant applications; 14% in various other metallic applications; and 31% in a variety of chemical applications. The total estimated value of cobalt consumed in 2019 was $400 million.'","'In 2019, cobalt contained in purchased scrap represented an estimated 29% of cobalt reported consumption.'","'Congo (Kinshasa) continued to be the worlds leading source of mined cobalt, supplying approximately 70% of world cobalt mine production. With the exception of production in Morocco and artisanally mined cobalt in Congo (Kinshasa), most cobalt is mined as a byproduct of copper or nickel. China was the worlds leading producer of refined cobalt, most of which it produced from partially refined cobalt imported from Congo (Kinshasa). China was the worlds leading consumer of cobalt, with more than 80% of its consumption being used by the rechargeable battery industry. During the first 7 months of 2019, cobalt prices generally trended downward, which analysts attributed to oversupply and consumer destocking and deferral of purchases. In early August, a Switzerland-based producer and marketer of commodities announced that, owing to low cobalt prices, it planned to place its world-leading cobalt mine on care-and-maintenance status by yearend 2019. Following the announcement, cobalt prices increased, then stabilized. '","'Identified cobalt resources of the United States are estimated to be about 1 million tons. Most of these resources are in Minnesota, but other important occurrences are in Alaska, California, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. With the exception of resources in Idaho and Missouri, any future cobalt production from these deposits would be as a byproduct of another metal. Identified world terrestrial cobalt resources are about 25 million tons. The vast majority of these resources are in sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits in Congo (Kinshasa) and Zambia; nickel-bearing laterite deposits in Australia and nearby island countries and Cuba; and magmatic nickel-copper sulfide deposits hosted in mafic and ultramafic rocks in Australia, Canada, Russia, and the United States. More than 120 million tons of cobalt resources have been identified in manganese nodules and crusts on the floor of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.'","'Depending on the application, substitution for cobalt could result in a loss in product performance or an increase in cost. The cobalt contents of lithium-ion batteries, the leading global use for cobalt, are expected to be reduced rather than eliminated; nickel contents of lithium-ion batteries will increase as cobalt contents decrease. Potential substitutes in other applications include barium or strontium ferrites, neodymium-iron-boron, or nickel-iron alloys in magnets; cerium, iron, lead, manganese, or vanadium in paints; cobalt-iron-copper or iron-copper in diamond tools; copper-iron-manganese for curing unsaturated polyester resins; iron, iron-cobalt-nickel, nickel, cermets, or ceramics in cutting and wear-resistant materials; nickel-based alloys or ceramics in jet engines; nickel in petroleum catalysts; rhodium in hydroformylation catalysts; and titanium-based alloys in prosthetics.'"
