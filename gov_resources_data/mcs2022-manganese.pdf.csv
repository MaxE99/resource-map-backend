1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'Manganese ore containing 20% or more manganese has not been produced domestically since 1970. Manganese ore was consumed mainly by six companies with plants principally in the East and Midwest. Most ore consumption was related to steel production, either directly in pig iron manufacture or indirectly through upgrading the ore to ferroalloys. Manganese ferroalloys were produced at two plants. Additional quantities of ore were used for nonmetallurgical purposes such as in the production of animal feed, brick colorant, dry cell batteries, and fertilizers.'","'Manganese was recycled incidentally as a constituent of ferrous and nonferrous scrap; however, scrap recovery specifically for manganese was negligible. Manganese is recovered along with iron from steel slag.'","'Global production of steel, the leading use of manganese, increased in 2021 compared with production in 2020 owing to increased demand following the negative effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Global production of manganese ore was estimated to be about 6% more than that in 2020. The leading countries for manganese ore production were, in descending order on a contained-weight basis, South Africa, Gabon, and Australia. On a contained-weight basis, total U.S. manganese imports were estimated to have increased by approximately 20% in 2021 compared with those in 2020. By October 2021, average spot market prices for manganese ore from China had increased by 13% compared with the annual average spot price in 2020.'","'"" Land-based manganese resources are large but irregularly distributed; those in the United States are very low grade and have potentially high extraction costs. South Africa accounts for about 30% of the worlds manganese reserves.'",'Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications.'
