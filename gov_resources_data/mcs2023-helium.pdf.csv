MCM,,2021,2022,"'The estimated value of Grade-A helium (99.997% helium or greater) sold during 2022 by private industry was about $820 million. Five plants (three in Texas and two in Kansas) extracted helium from natural gas and produced crude helium that ranged from 50% to 80% helium. Five plants (two in Kansas, one each in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma) produced gaseous helium that ranged from 95% to 99.5% helium. Four plants (two in Colorado and one each in Utah and Wyoming) extracted helium from natural gas and produced Grade-A helium. Three plants in Kansas and one in Oklahoma accepted crude helium from other producers and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) pipeline and purified it to Grade-A helium. In 2022, estimated domestic apparent consumption of Grade-A helium was 43 million cubic meters (1.5 billion cubic feet), and it was used for, in descending order by estimated quantity, magnetic resonance imaging, lifting gas, analytical and laboratory applications, electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, welding, engineering and scientific applications, and various other minor applications.'","'In the United States, helium used in large-volume applications is seldom recycled. Some low-volume or liquid boil-off recovery systems are used. In the rest of the world, helium recycling is more common.'","'Helium sales in 2022 decreased slightly in the United States owing to several unplanned shutdowns taking place, including the BLM Crude Helium Enrichment Unit, which was not operational from mid-January 2022 through late June 2022. World helium production, excluding the United States, decreased owing to delays of added production capacity in Russia, helium plant shutdowns in Qatar, reduced separation of helium from natural gas in Algeria, and constraints on transportation for helium products.'","' Section 16 of Public Law 113-40 required the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to complete a national helium gas assessment. The USGS and the BLM coordinated efforts to complete this assessment, which was published by the USGS in fall 2021.1 The mean volume of recoverable helium within the known geologic natural gas reservoirs in the United States was estimated to be 8,490 million cubic meters (306 billion cubic feet). This does not include the remaining 60.7 million cubic meters (2.19 billion cubic feet) in the Federal helium inventory. The estimated mean for the Midcontinent region was 4,330 million cubic meters (156 billion cubic feet); the Rocky Mountain region, 4,110 million cubic meters (148 billion cubic feet); the North Central region, 52.7 million cubic meters (1.9 billion cubic feet); the Gulf Coast region, 12.5 million cubic meters (0.45 billion cubic feet); and the Alaska region, 1.11 million cubic meters (0.04 billion cubic feet). Helium resources of the world, exclusive of the United States, were estimated to be about 31.3 billion cubic meters (1.13 trillion cubic feet). The locations and volumes of the major deposits, in billion cubic meters, are Qatar, 10.1; Algeria, 8.2; Russia, 6.8; Canada, 2.0; and China, 1.1.'","'Nothing substitutes for helium in cryogenic applications if temperatures below -429 degrees Fahrenheit are required. Argon can be substituted for helium in welding, and hydrogen can be substituted for helium in some lighter-than-air applications in which the flammable nature of hydrogen is not objectionable. Hydrogen is also being investigated as a substitute for helium in deep-sea diving applications below 305 meters (1,000 feet).'"
