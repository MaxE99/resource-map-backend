1000 MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,2022000.0,2022.0,"'In 2022, seven open pit iron ore mines (each with associated concentration and pelletizing plants) in Michigan and Minnesota shipped 98% of domestic usable iron ore products, which were consumed in the steel industry in the United States. The remaining 2% of domestic iron ore products were consumed in nonsteel end uses. In 2022, the United States produced iron ore with an estimated value of $5.2 billion, a 22% decrease from $6.7 billion in 2021. Four iron metallic plantsone direct-reduced iron (DRI) plant in Louisiana and three hot-briquetted iron (HBI) plants in Indiana, Ohio, and Texasoperated during the year to supply steelmaking raw materials with an estimated value of $1.3 billion. The United States was estimated to have produced 1.8% and consumed 1.5% of the worlds iron ore output.'",'None.',"'Slight decreases in production and trade in 2022 were due to rising global inflation, which resulted in decreased steel demand and consumption. Domestic iron ore production was estimated to be 46 million tons in 2022, a 3% decrease from 47.5 million tons in 2021. Total raw steel production was estimated to have decreased to 82 million tons in 2022 from 85.5 million tons in 2021. The World Steel Association4 forecast global finished steel consumption to decrease by 2.3% in 2022 and increase by 1.0% in 2023. End-use consumption of steel products was expected to decline in 2022 following concurrent events affecting consumer demand, including the conflict in Ukraine, continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation measures in China, and rising energy costs and interest rates. Overall, global prices trended downward to an average year-to-date unit value of $128.65 per ton in the first 9 months of 2022, a 28% decrease from the 2021 average year-to-date unit value of $178.27 per ton, but the 2022 average year-to-date unit value was a 28% increase from the 2020 average year-to-date unit value of $100.83 per ton. Based on reported prices for iron ore fines (62% iron content) imported into China (cost, insurance, and freight into Tianjin Port), the highest monthly average price during the first 9 months of 2022 was $152.07 per ton in March compared with the high of $214.43 per ton in June 2021. The lowest monthly average price during the same period in 2022 was $99.80 per ton in September compared with the low of $96.24 per ton in November 2021. In November, one company petitioned the Minnesota Supreme Court for a review of State mineral leases that were terminated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. In October, another company began construction on a $150 million project to build a direct-reduced grade pellet plant that could be sold or feed a potential future DRI or HBI plant. An iron ore mine in northern Minnesota was expected to deplete its reserves of iron ore around 2025, and the companys leadership was seeking the land and mineral rights to a nearby deposit where construction of a new mine and facility was stalled and the mineral leases were expected to be reassigned in the near future. '",'U.S. resources are estimated to be 110 billion tons of iron ore containing about 27 billion tons of iron. U.S. resources are mainly low-grade taconite-type ores from the Lake Superior district that require beneficiation and agglomeration prior to commercial use. World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron.',"'The only source of primary iron is iron ore, used directly as direct-shipping ore or converted to briquettes, concentrates, DRI, iron nuggets, pellets, or sinter. DRI, iron nuggets, and scrap are extensively used for steelmaking in electric arc furnaces and in iron and steel foundries. Technological advancements have been made that allow hematite to be recovered from tailings basins and pelletized.'"
