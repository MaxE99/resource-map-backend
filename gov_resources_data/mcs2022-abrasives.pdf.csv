MT,,2020,2021,2020,2021,"'Fused aluminum oxide was produced by two companies at three plants in the United States and Canada. Production of crude fused aluminum oxide had an estimated value of $3.0 million. Silicon carbide was produced by two companies at two plants in the United States. Production of crude silicon carbide had an estimated value of about $30 million. Metallic abrasives were produced by 11 companies in eight States. Production of metallic abrasives had an estimated value of about $100 million. Bonded and coated abrasive products accounted for most abrasive uses of fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide. Metallic abrasives are used primarily for steel shot and grit and cut wire shot, which are used for sandblasting, peening, and stonecutting applications.'","'Up to 30% of fused aluminum oxide may be recycled, and about 5% of silicon carbide is recycled.'","'In 2021, China was the worlds leading producer of abrasive fused aluminum oxide and abrasive silicon carbide. Imports, especially from China where operating costs were lower, continued to challenge abrasives producers in the United States and Canada. In recent years, imports of abrasives from Hong Kong have also increased. Foreign competition is expected to persist and continue to limit production in North America. The average unit value of imports had increased every year since 2016 for regular fused aluminum oxide and crude silicon carbide but have decreased since 2020. The average unit values of imports of regular fused aluminum oxide and crude silicon carbide during the first 7 months of 2021 were 6% and 14% lower, respectively, than those in 2020 and 13% and 33% lower, respectively, than those in 2019. Abrasives consumption in the United States is greatly influenced by activity in the manufacturing sectors, particularly the aerospace, automotive, furniture, housing, and steel industries. Automobile and steel production were greatly affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic as well as a global semiconductor chip shortage, which in turn reduced the demand for metallic abrasives. Domestic production remains consistent, although foreign trade continues to be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Imports and exports showed signs of recovery from 2020, but they remained significantly below pre- pandemic levels. Additionally, a global container shortage arose that greatly delayed shipments and caused container prices to nearly double compared with prices in 2020. '","'* Although domestic resources of raw materials for fused aluminum oxide production are limited, adequate resources are available in the Western Hemisphere. Domestic resources are more than adequate for silicon carbide production.'","'Natural and manufactured abrasives, such as garnet, emery, or metallic abrasives, can be substituted for fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide in various applications.'"
