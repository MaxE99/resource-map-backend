1000 MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'Manganese ore containing 20% or more manganese has not been produced domestically since 1970. Manganese ore was consumed mainly by eight firms with plants principally in the East and Midwest. Most ore consumption was related to steel production, either directly in pig iron manufacture or indirectly through upgrading the ore to ferroalloys. Additional quantities of ore were used for such nonmetallurgical purposes as production of dry cell batteries, in fertilizers and animal feed, and as a brick colorant. Manganese ferroalloys were produced at two plants. Construction, transportation, and machinery end uses accounted for about 43%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, of manganese consumption on a manganese-content basis. Most of the rest went to a variety of other iron and steel applications. In 2019, the value of domestic consumption, estimated from foreign trade data ona manganese-content basis, was about $1.2 billion.'","'Manganese was recycled incidentally as a constituent of ferrous and nonferrous scrap; however, scrap recovery specifically for manganese was negligible. Manganese is recovered along with iron from steel slag.'","'U.S. manganese apparent consumption was estimated to have decreased by 7% to 740,000 tons in 2019 compared with that in 2018 as a result of decreases in U.S. ferromanganese and silicomanganese imports. Electrolytic manganese metal was newly added to the National Defense Stockpile in 2019 as a critical material for defense purposes; the last time electrolytic manganese metal was held in the Government stockpile was in 2004.'","'Land-based manganese resources are large but irregularly distributed; those in the United States are very low grade and have potentially high extraction costs. South Africa accounts for about 74% of the worlds identified manganese resources, and Ukraine accounts for about 10%.'",'Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications.'
