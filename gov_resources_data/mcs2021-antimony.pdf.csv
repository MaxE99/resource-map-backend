MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'In 2020, no marketable antimony was mined in the United States. A mine in Nevada that had extracted about 800 tons of stibnite ore from 2013 through 2014 was placed on care-and-maintenance status in 2015 and had no reported production in 2020. Primary antimony metal and oxide were produced by one company in Montana using imported feedstock. Secondary antimony production was derived mostly from antimonial lead recovered from spent lead-acid batteries. The estimated value of secondary antimony produced in 2020, based on the average New York dealer price for antimony, was about $35 million. Recycling supplied about 18% of estimated domestic consumption, and the remainder came mostly from imports. The value of antimony consumption in 2020, based on the average New York dealer price, was about $193 million. In the United States, the leading uses of antimony were as follows: flame retardants, 42%; metal products, including antimonial lead and ammunition, 36%; and nonmetal products, including ceramics and glass and rubber products, 22%.'","'The bulk of secondary antimony is recovered at secondary lead smelters as antimonial lead, most of which was generated by, and then consumed by, the lead-acid battery industry.'","'China continued to be the leading global antimony producer in 2020 and accounted for more than 52% of global mine production. Owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent very tight supply of antimony raw materials, operations at Chinas refineries were constrained. According to Chinas customs data, China imported 30% less of antimony ore and concentrates from January through August 2020 than for the same period of 2019. This caused a supply shortage of antimony ingots on the market and the antimony price increased to about $4.00 per pound in 2020. In 2020, China imported 83% less unwrought antimony than in the previous year. Exports of Chinas unwrought antimony and antimony oxide fell by 24% and 12%, respectively.'","'* U.S. resources of antimony are mainly in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada. Principal identified world resources are in Australia, Bolivia, China, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Tajikistan. Additional antimony resources may occur in Mississippi Valley-type lead deposits in the Eastern United States.'","'Selected organic compounds and hydrated aluminum oxide are substitutes as flame retardants. Chromium, tin, titanium, zinc, and zirconium compounds substitute for antimony chemicals in enamels, paint, and pigments. Combinations of calcium, copper, selenium, sulfur, and tin are substitutes for alloys in lead-acid batteries.'"
