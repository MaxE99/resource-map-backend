1000 MT,,2018,2019,2018,2019,2018000.0,2019.0,"'In 2019, mines in Michigan and Minnesota shipped 98% of the usable iron ore products consumed in the steel industry in the United States with an estimated value of $5.4 billion, an increase from $4.6 billion in 2018. The remaining 2% of domestic iron ore was produced for nonsteel end uses. Seven open-pit iron ore mines (each with associated concentration and pelletizing plants), and three iron metallic plantsone direct- reduced iron (DRI) plant in Louisiana and two hot-briquetted iron (HBI) plants in Indiana and Texasoperated during the year to supply steelmaking raw materials. The United States was estimated to have produced 1.9% and consumed 2.0% of the worlds iron ore output.'",'None. See Iron and Steel Scrap.',"'U.S. iron ore production was estimated to have decreased slightly in 2019 owing to a decrease in domestic pig iron production and raw steel production from basic oxygen furnaces. Total raw steel production was estimated to have increased to 87 million tons in 2019 from 86.6 million tons in 2018. The share of steel produced by basic oxygen furnaces, the process that uses iron ore, continued to decline from 37.3% in 2015 to an estimated 30% in 2019 owing to increased use of electric arc furnaces because of their energy efficiency, reduced environmental impacts, and the ready supply of scrap. Overall, global prices trended upwards in 2019 and the annual average value of $112.15 per ton was a 21% increase from $93.00 per ton in 2018. Based on reported prices for iron ore fines (62% iron content) imported into China (cost and freight into Tianjin port), the highest monthly average price during the first 10 months of 2019 was $120.24 per ton in July compared with the high of $77.46 per ton in February 2018. The lowest monthly average price during the same period in 2019 was $76.16 per ton in January compared with the low of $64.56 per ton in July 2018. The prices trended upwards owing to an estimated 4% increase in raw steel production and a reduced supply of higher grade iron ore products, spurred partially by closures of pelletizing plants in Brazil. In August, one company completed a project at an iron-ore-processing facility in Minnesota enabling the plant to produce 3.5 million tons per year of direct-reduced-iron-grade pellets that will feed into a hot-briquetted plant under construction in Ohio, which was expected to open in mid-2020. Globally, iron ore production in 2019 was expected to increase by 5% from that of 2018, primarily owing to increased production in Australia, Brazil, China, and India. Global finished steel demand was forecast by the World Steel Association5 to increase by 3.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, as a result of real estate investment in China and 4.1% growth in emerging and developing economies in 2020. Steel demand among developed economies, except for China, was expected to remain the same or decrease slightly in 2019 despite growth in consumer and construction applications as potential and enacted trade policies impacted investments and exports among the manufacturing sector. Increased pressure on steel producers around the world to increase efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and meet environmental benchmarks continued the slow decline in use of low-grade iron ore and spurred investment in the production of iron metallics and high-grade iron ore products, such as pellets.'",'U.S. resources are estimated to be 110 billion tons of iron ore containing about 27 billion tons of iron. U.S. resources are mainly low-grade taconite-type ores from the Lake Superior district that require beneficiation and agglomeration prior to commercial use. World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron.',"'The only source of primary iron is iron ore, used directly as direct-shipping ore or converted to briquettes, concentrates, DRI, iron nuggets, pellets, or sinter. DRI, iron nuggets, and scrap are extensively used for steelmaking in electric arc furnaces and in iron and steel foundries. Technological advancements have been made, which allow hematite to be recovered from tailings basins and pelletized.'"
