MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'In 2021, the underground Eagle Mine in Michigan produced approximately 18,000 tons of nickel in concentrate, which was exported to smelters in Canada and overseas. A company in Missouri recovered metals, including nickel, from mine tailings as part of the Superfund Redevelopment Initiative. Nickel in crystalline sulfate was produced as a byproduct of smelting and refining platinum-group-metal ores mined in Montana. In the United States, the leading uses for primary nickel are alloys and steels, electroplating, and other uses including catalysts and chemicals. Stainless and alloy steel and nickel-containing alloys typically account for more than 85% of domestic consumption.'","""Nickel in alloyed form was recovered from the processing of nickel-containing waste, including flue dust, grinding swarf, mill scale, and shot blast generated during the manufacturing of stainless steel; filter cakes, plating solutions, spent catalysts, spent pickle liquor, sludges, and all types of spent nickel-containing batteries. Nickel- containing alloys and stainless-steel scrap were also melted and used to produce new alloys and stainless steel. The U.S. Department of Energy's ReCell Center continued to investigate methods to more effectively recover raw materials, including nickel, from recycled batteries. In 2021, recycled nickel in all forms accounted for approximately 52% of apparent consumption.""","'On November 9, 2021, a proposed revised U.S. critical minerals list was published in the Federal Register (86 FR 62199). The new list contained 50 individual mineral commodities; proposed changes were the addition of nickel and zinc and the removal of helium, potash, rhenium, strontium, and uranium, which were included in the 2018 critical minerals list. In 2021, the annual average LME cash price was estimated to have increased by 30% compared with that in 2020, which was attributed to expectations of increased use of nickel in electric vehicle batteries and continued strong demand for stainless steel. Mine production in Indonesia increased by an estimated 30%, which was facilitated by the ongoing commissioning of integrated nickel pig iron and stainless-steel projects. The countrys first hydrometallurgical plant began operation in May on Obi Island. It was among several similar projects in the country that were designed to produce intermediate nickel products to be used as feed material at battery-grade nickel sulfate plants'","'Identified land-based resources averaging approximately 0.5% nickel or greater contain at least 300 million tons of nickel, with about 60% in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits. Extensive nickel resources also are found in manganese crusts and nodules on the ocean floor.'","'Low-nickel, duplex, or ultrahigh-chromium stainless steels have been substituted for austenitic grades in construction. Nickel-free specialty steels are sometimes used in place of stainless steel in the power-generating and petrochemical industries. Titanium alloys can substitute for nickel metal or nickel-base alloys in corrosive chemical environments.'"
