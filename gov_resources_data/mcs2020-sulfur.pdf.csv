1000 MT,,2018,2019,"'In 2019, recovered elemental sulfur and byproduct sulfuric acid were produced at 95 operations in 27 States. Total shipments were valued at about $440 million. Elemental sulfur production was estimated to be 8.2 million tons; Louisiana and Texas accounted for about 55% of domestic production. Elemental sulfur was recovered, in descending order of tonnage, at petroleum refineries, natural-gas-processing plants, and coking plants by 35 companies at 90 plants in 26 States. Byproduct sulfuric acid, representing about 7% of production of sulfur in all forms, was recovered at five nonferrous-metal smelters in four States by four companies. Domestic elemental sulfur provided 62% of domestic consumption, and byproduct acid accounted for about 6%. The remaining 32% of sulfur consumed was provided by imported sulfur and sulfuric acid. About 90% of sulfur consumed was in the form of sulfuric acid.'","'Typically, between 2.5 million and 5 million tons of spent sulfuric acid is reclaimed from petroleum refining and chemical processes during any given year.'","'Total U.S. sulfur production in 2019 was estimated to have decreased by 9% from that of 2018 and shipments also decreased by 9% from those of 2018. Domestic production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refineries and recovery from natural gas operations decreased by 9%. A decline in refinery operating utilization and processing of more sweet crude oil likely lead to decreased production. Domestically, refinery sulfur production is expected to remain relatively constant as well as byproduct sulfuric acid, unless one or more of the remaining nonferrous-metal smelters close. Domestic phosphate rock consumption in 2019 was estimated to be slightly lower than that in 2018, which resulted in decreased consumption of sulfur to process the phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizers. World sulfur production was about the same as it was in 2018 but is likely to steadily increase for the foreseeable future. New sulfur demand associated with phosphate fertilizer projects is expected in west Asia and Africa. A major change for 2020 will be the implementation of new international standards limiting sulfur oxide emissions from ships on January 1, 2020. The global sulfur content of marine fuels would be limited to 0.5% sulfur content from 3.5% sulfur content, likely leading to increased sulfur production in North America, Asia, and Europe. Contract sulfur prices in Tampa, FL, began 2019 at around $140 per ton. The sulfur price continued to decrease throughout the year and reached about $46 per ton in early October, the lowest price since 2009. The price decrease was a result of a weak phosphate fertilizer market. Prices for exported sulfur were higher than domestic prices. In the past few years, sulfur prices have been variable, a result of the volatility in the demand for sulfur. '","'Resources of elemental sulfur in evaporite and volcanic deposits, and sulfur associated with natural gas, petroleum, tar sands, and metal sulfides, total about 5 billion tons. The sulfur in gypsum and anhydrite is almost limitless, and 600 billion tons of sulfur is contained in coal, oil shale, and shale rich in organic matter. Production from these sources would require development of low-cost methods of extraction. The domestic sulfur resource is about one-fifth of the world total.'","'Substitutes for sulfur at present or anticipated price levels are not satisfactory; some acids, in certain applications, may be substituted for sulfuric acid, but usually at a higher cost.'"
