1 M. MT,,2018.0,2019.0,"'In 2019, 1.53 billion tons of crushed stone valued at more than $18.7 billion was produced by an estimated 1,430 companies operating 3,440 quarries and 176 sales and (or) distribution yards in 50 States. Leading States were, in descending order of production, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Virginia, Illinois, and Kentucky, which combined accounted for more than one-half of the total crushed stone output. Of the total domestic crushed stone produced in 2018, about 69% was limestone and dolomite; 15%, granite; 6%, traprock; 5%, miscellaneous stone; 3%, sandstone and quartzite; and the remaining 2% was divided, in descending order of tonnage, among marble, volcanic cinder and scoria, calcareous marl, slate, and shell. It is estimated that of the 1.6 billion tons of crushed stone consumed in the United States in 2019, 72% was used as construction aggregate, mostly for road construction and maintenance; 16% for cement manufacturing; 8% for lime manufacturing; 3% for other chemical, special, and miscellaneous uses and products; and 2% for agricultural uses. The estimated output of crushed stone in the United States shipped for consumption in the first 9 months of 2019 was 1.14 billion tons, an increase of 8% compared with that of the same period of 2018. Third quarter shipments for consumption increased by 9% compared with those of the same period of 2018. Additional production information, by quarter for each State, geographic division, and the United States, is reported in the U.S. Geological Survey quarterly Mineral Industry Surveys for Crushed Stone and Sand and Gravel.'","'Road surfaces made of asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete surface layers, which contain crushed stone aggregate, were recycled on a limited but increasing basis in most States. In 2019, asphalt and portland cement concrete road surfaces were recycled in all 50 States.'","'Crushed stone production was about 1.53 billion tons in 2019, an increase of 8% compared with that of 2018. Apparent consumption also increased to about 1.60 billion tons. Consumption of crushed stone increased in 2019 because of continued growth in the private and public construction markets. Commercial and heavy industrial construction activity, infrastructure funding, new single-family housing unit starts, and weather, affect growth in crushed stone production and consumption. Long-term increases in construction aggregates demand are influenced by activity in the public and private construction sectors, as well as by construction work related to security measures being implemented around the Nation. The underlying factors that would support a rise in prices of crushed stone are expected to be present in 2020, especially in and near metropolitan areas. The crushed stone industry continued to be concerned with environmental, health, and safety regulations. Shortages in some urban and industrialized areas are expected to continue to increase owing to local zoning regulations and land-development alternatives. These issues are expected to continue and to cause new crushed stone quarries to locate away from large population centers.'",'Stone resources are plentiful throughout the world. Supply of high-purity limestone and dolomite suitable for specialty uses is limited in many geographic areas. The largest resources of high-purity limestone and dolomite in the United States are in the central and eastern parts of the country.',"'Crushed stone substitutes for roadbuilding include sand and gravel, and iron and steel slag. Substitutes for crushed stone used as construction aggregates include construction sand and gravel, iron and steel slag, sintered or expanded clay or shale, perlite, or vermiculite. Increasingly, recycled asphalt and portland cement concretes are being substituted for virgin aggregate, although the percentage of total aggregate supplied by recycled materials remained very small in 2019.'"
