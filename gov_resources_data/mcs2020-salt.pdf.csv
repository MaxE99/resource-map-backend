1000 MT,,2018,2019,"'Domestic production of salt was estimated to have increased slightly in 2019 to 42 million tons. The total value of salt sold or used was estimated to be about $2.3 billion. Twenty-six companies operated 63 plants in 16 States. The top producing States were, in alphabetical order, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Utah. These seven States produced about 92% of the salt in the United States in 2019. The estimated percentage of salt sold or used was, by type, rock salt, 41%; salt in brine, 41%; vacuum pan salt, 10%; and solar salt, 8%. Highway deicing accounted for about 43% of total salt consumed. The chemical industry accounted for about 37% of total salt sales, with salt in brine accounting for 89% of the salt used for chemical feedstock. Chlorine and caustic soda manufacturers were the main consumers within the chemical industry. The remaining markets for salt were, in declining order of use, distributors, 9%; food processing, 4%; agricultural, 3%, general industrial, 2%; and primary water treatment, 1%. The remaining 1% was other uses combined with exports.'",'None.',"'The winter was slightly colder than average in 2018-19 for the second consecutive year. The number of winter weather events was greater than the last few years in many parts of the United States, including an increase in episodes of freeing rain and sleet, requiring more salt for highway deicing. Rock salt production and imports in 2019 remained at about the same level as that of 2018 because demand from many local and State transportation departments remained relatively high. Most local and State governments in regions that experience cold winters reportedly had depleted stockpiles and needed to replenish supplies of rock salt for the winter of 2019-20. For the winter of 201920, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a neutral weather pattern without El Nio or La Nia affects: other weather patterns were expected to have a greater influence. Forecasts include warmer than average temperatures for the northeastern, northwestern, and southern areas of the United States, and the northern plains and Midwest are expected to have average temperatures. Areas from the mid-Atlantic to the northern Rocky Mountains are predicted to have a wetter than average winter, but much of New England and most of the South are forecast to have average precipitation. The early part of the season was noticeably cooler and wetter than normal, and consumers of rock salt had already begun to use stockpiles of salt and considered increasing salt purchases for the remainder of the winter season. Demand for salt brine used in the chloralkali industry was expected to increase as demand for caustic soda increased globally, especially in Asia. Exports from Australia and especially India increased to meet the increasing demand for caustic soda in China.'","'World continental resources of salt are vast, and the salt content in the oceans is nearly unlimited. Domestic resources of rock salt and salt from brine are primarily in Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Texas. Saline lakes and solar evaporation salt facilities are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah. Almost every country in the world has salt deposits or solar evaporation operations of various sizes.'","'No economic substitutes or alternatives for salt exist in most applications. Calcium chloride and calcium magnesium acetate, hydrochloric acid, and potassium chloride can be substituted for salt in deicing, certain chemical processes, and food flavoring, but at a higher cost.'"
