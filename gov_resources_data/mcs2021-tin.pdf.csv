MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'Tin has not been mined or smelted in the United States since 1993 and 1989, respectively. Twenty-five firms accounted for over 90% of the primary tin consumed domestically in 2020. The major uses for tin in the United States were tinplate, 21%; chemicals, 18%; solder, 15%; alloys, 10%; babbitt, brass and bronze, and tinning, 10%; and other, 26%. Based on the average Platts Metals Week New York dealer price for tin, the estimated value of imported refined tin in 2020 was $557 million, and the estimated value of tin recovered from old scrap domestically in 2020 was $174 million.'","'About 18,000 tons of tin from old and new scrap was estimated to have been recycled in 2020. Of this, about 10,000 tons was recovered from old scrap at 2 detinning plants and about 75 secondary nonferrous metal- processing plants, accounting for 24% of apparent consumption.'","'The estimated amount of tin recycled in 2020 remained essentially unchanged compared with that in 2019. Estimated annual average tin prices based on the first 11 months in 2020 were 790 and 770 cents per pound for the New York dealer price and LME cash price, respectivelya 9% decrease for both prices compared with those in 2019. In 2020, the monthly average New York dealer tin price peaked in November at 856 cents per pound, from a low monthly average price of 705 cents per pound in April. Decline in global tin use began in 2019 and continued through 2020, likely exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic that has caused disruptions in mining and manufacturing industries around the world. Solder remains the largest global use of tin. Owing to pandemic-related consumption of canned foods, tinplate usage is expected to increase despite years of stagnation. The use of tin in chemicals and tin alloys is expected to decline from that in 2019, matching the overall decline in demand for many durable goods in 2020. Chinese demand for tin in the third quarter of 2020 reached 2019 levels, despite pandemic-related declines in the first half of 2020. China struggled to source an adequate supply of tin as global mine production only partially recovered in the third quarter. In Burma, further issues with mine flooding and border restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic have tightened traditional tin ore sources. In late 2020, Chinas Yunnan Tin Company Limited began operations at a new smelter in Yunnan Province. The new smelter will replace an existing, and soon-to-be decommissioned, facility in the same Province.'","'* Identified resources of tin in the United States, primarily in Alaska, were insignificant compared with those of the rest of the world. World resources, principally in western Africa, southeastern Asia, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, and Russia, are extensive and, if developed, could sustain recent annual production rates well into the future.'","'Aluminum, glass, paper, plastic, or tin-free steel substitute for tin content in cans and containers. Other materials that substitute for tin are epoxy resins for solder; aluminum alloys, alternative copper-base alloys, and plastics for bronze; plastics for bearing metals that contain tin; and compounds of lead and sodium for some tin chemicals.'"
