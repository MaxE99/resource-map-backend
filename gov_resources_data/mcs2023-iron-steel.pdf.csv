1 M. MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,"'The U.S. iron and steel industry produced raw steel in 2022 with an estimated value of about $132 billion, a 13% increase from $118 billion in 2021. Pig iron and raw steel were produced by three companies operating integrated steel mills in 11 locations. Raw steel was produced by 50 companies at 101 minimills. Combined production capacity was about 106 million tons per year. Indiana accounted for an estimated 26% of total raw steel production, followed by Ohio, 12%; Pennsylvania and Illinois, 5% each; Texas, 4%; and Michigan, 3%; with no other State having more than 3% of total domestic raw steel production. Construction accounted for an estimated 46% of total domestic shipments by market classification, followed by transportation (predominantly automotive), 26%; machinery and equipment, 8%; energy, 6%; appliances, 5%; and other applications, 9%.'",'See the Iron and Steel Scrap and Iron and Steel Slag chapters.',"'The World Steel Association forecast global finished steel consumption to decrease by 2.3% in 2022 and increase by 1.0% in 2023. End-use consumption of steel products was expected to decline in 2022 following concurrent events affecting consumer demand, including the conflict in Ukraine, continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation measures in China, rising energy costs and interest rates, and global inflation. In the United States, the apparent consumption of finished steel products was estimated to have increased by 2% in 2022 owing to strong economic recovery from COVID-19 supply disruptions. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was expected to spur growth in the energy and construction sectors. The economic conditions in China significantly affected steel production, with finished steel production decreasing by 4% in 2022 and expected to remain unchanged in 2023 owing to extended COVID-19 mitigation strategies that led to decreased demand for real estate and construction investments. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, steel demand was estimated to be lower in 2022 owing to decreases in the construction sector. Production of finished steel products in India was expected to increase by 6% in 2022 owing to infrastructure spending, strong demand for consumer goods, and increased demand in the automotive sector. '",'Not applicable. See the Iron Ore chapter for steelmaking raw-material resources.',"'Iron is the least expensive and most widely used metal. In most applications, iron and steel compete either with less expensive nonmetallic materials or with more expensive materials that have a performance advantage. Iron and steel compete with lighter materials, such as aluminum and plastics in the automotive industry; aluminum, concrete, and wood in construction; and aluminum, glass, paper, and plastics in containers.'"
