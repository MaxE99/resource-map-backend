MT,,2018,2019,2019.0,"'In 2019, the underground Eagle Mine in Michigan produced approximately 14,000 tons of nickel in concentrate, which was exported to smelters in Canada and overseas. In October, the mine processed the first ore from the newly developed Eagle East extension. As part of the Superfund Redevelopment Initiative, a company in Missouri constructed a facility to recover metals, including nickel, from mine tailings. Nickel in crystalline sulfate was produced as a byproduct of smelting and refining platinum-group-metal ores mined in Montana. In the United States, the leading uses for primary nickel are stainless and alloy steels, nonferrous alloys and superalloys, electroplating, and other uses including catalysts and chemicals. Domestic production of stainless steel was estimated to have decreased by approximately 10% in 2019. Consumption of nickel used in alloys for jet turbine engines continued to increase. '","'Nickel in alloyed form was recovered from the processing of nickel-containing waste, including flue dust, grinding swarf, mill scale, and shot blast generated during the manufacturing of stainless steel; filter cakes, plating solutions, spent catalysts, spent pickle liquor, sludges, and all types of spent nickel-containing batteries. Nickel- containing alloys and stainless steel scrap were also melted and used to produce new alloys and stainless steel. In 2019, recycled nickel in all forms accounted for approximately 47% of apparent consumption.'","'The Government of Indonesia decided to reinstate its ban on direct-shipping nickel ore beginning in January 2020, 2 years earlier than previously announced. The Government had relaxed enforcement of the ban in 2017 following rapid development of the countrys nickel-processing capacity, primarily smelters producing nickel pig iron. The return to the regulation was reportedly in order to conserve ore for the domestic processing industry. In January 2019, a company in Indonesias Central Sulawesi Province broke ground on a project to produce nickel and cobalt for use in batteries. Globally, numerous idled facilities and delayed development projects resumed activity in anticipation of growing demand for nickel in electric vehicle batteries.'","'Identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel, with about 60% in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits. Extensive nickel resources also are found in manganese crusts and nodules on the ocean floor. The decline in discovery of new sulfide deposits in traditional mining districts has led to exploration in more challenging locations such as east-central Africa and the subarctic.'","'Low-nickel, duplex, or ultrahigh-chromium stainless steels are being substituted for austenitic grades in construction. Nickel-free specialty steels are sometimes used in place of stainless steel in the power-generating and petrochemical industries. Titanium alloys can substitute for nickel metal or nickel-base alloys in corrosive chemical environments. Lithium-ion batteries may be used instead of nickel metal hydride batteries in certain applications.'"
