1 M. MT,,2019,2020,2019,2020,"'The U.S. iron and steel industry produced raw steel in 2020 with an estimated value of about $91 billion, an 12% decrease from $104 billion in 2019 and $103 billion in 2018. Pig iron and raw steel was produced by three companies operating integrated steel mills in 11 locations. Raw steel was produced by 51 companies at 98 minimills. Combined production capacity was about 110 million tons. Indiana accounted for an estimated 26% of total raw steel production, followed by Ohio, 12%; Michigan, 5%; and Pennsylvania, 5%, with no other State having more than 5% of total domestic raw steel production. Construction accounted for an estimated 46% of total domestic shipments by market classification, followed by transportation (predominantly automotive), 26%; machinery and equipment, 8%; energy, 6%; appliances, 5%; and other applications, 9%.'",'See Iron and Steel Scrap and Iron and Steel Slag.',"'The World Steel Association forecast global finished steel consumption to decrease by 2.4% in 2020 as a result of the impacts related to reduced consumption and demand of manufactured products, new construction, and other consumable goods owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic. On a monthly basis, global steel demand reached its lowest point in April; however, the rate of economic recovery in various countries has been variable owing to differences in containment strategies, the domestic industry structure, and economic measures to combat slowing economic growth. A rebound in steel demand later in the year following easing of restrictions was not enough to offset early losses in consumption. In April, multiple U.S.-based blast furnaces were idled owing to the reduced steel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; however, they all reopened in the second half of 2020. In August, one iron ore and iron metallics company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase two iron ore mines, six steelmaking facilities, eight finishing facilities, and three coal and cokemaking operations from another domestic iron and steel production company, making it the largest manufacturer of flat-rolled steel in North America. '",'Not applicable. See Iron Ore and Iron and Steel Scrap for steelmaking raw-material resources.',"'Iron is the least expensive and most widely used metal. In most applications, iron and steel compete either with less expensive nonmetallic materials or with more expensive materials that have a performance advantage. Iron and steel compete with lighter materials, such as aluminum and plastics, in the motor vehicle industry; aluminum, concrete, and wood in construction; and aluminum, glass, paper, and plastics in containers.'"
