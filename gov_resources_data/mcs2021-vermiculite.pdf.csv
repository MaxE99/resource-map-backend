1000 MT,,2019.0,2020.0,2020.0,"'Two companies with mining and processing facilities in South Carolina and Virginia produced approximately 100,000 tons of vermiculite concentrate; actual data have been rounded to one significant digit to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Flakes of raw vermiculite concentrate are micaceous in appearance and contain interlayer water in their structure. When the flakes are heated rapidly to a temperature above 870 C, the water flashes into steam, and the flakes expand into accordionlike particles. This process is called exfoliation or expansion, and the resulting ultralightweight material is chemically inert, fire resistant, and odorless. Most of the vermiculite concentrate produced in the United States was shipped to 17 exfoliating plants in 11 States. The end uses for exfoliated vermiculite were estimated to be agriculture and horticulture, 48%; lightweight concrete aggregates (including cement premixes, concrete, and plaster), 14%; insulation, 11%; and other, 27%.'",'Insignificant.',"'U.S. exports and imports of vermiculite are not collected as a separate category by the U.S. Census Bureau. Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. imports were estimated to be about 40,000 tons in 2020, essentially unchanged from those of 2019. Most imports came from South Africa and Brazil in 2020. One company announced price increases for vermiculite in 2020 but did not disclose specific price ranges. A company in Brazil continued to expand production capacity at its vermiculite mine in central Brazil and continued with the development of another deposit near Brasilia to bring the companys total production capacity to 200,000 tons per year. Companies in China with significant vermiculite resources also were ramping up production, although processing operations continued to be somewhat constrained by increased enforcement of environmental regulations. Specific production data were not available for China. Coarse-grade vermiculite remained in short supply. Sustained production at the 30,000-ton-per-year Namekara Mine in Uganda provides coarser grades to the market because it is considered to be one of the worlds largest vermiculite deposits with significant portions of medium- and coarse-grade material. The Namekara deposit has enough resources for more than 50 years of production at previously announced rates. The company in Uganda pursued mine planning strategies after becoming the 100% owner of the mine. Exploration and development of vermiculite deposits containing medium, large, and premium (coarser) grades (mostly in China and South Africa) are likely to continue because of the higher demand for those grades. Finer grade production has exceeded consumption for several years. However, coarser grade (greater than 5-millimeter particle size) production has not been able to keep up with demand. Producers will continue to investigate ways to increase the use of the finer grades in existing products and in uses that require coarse material. Innovative applications continue to emerge, including the use of vermiculite to combat air pollution and absorb water in mines, replacing zeolites in ion-exchange columns, purifying wastewater, and containing or removing nuclear waste.'","'In addition to the producing mines in South Carolina and Virginia, there are vermiculite occurrences in Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming which contain estimated resources of'","'Expanded perlite is a substitute for exfoliated vermiculite in lightweight concrete and plaster. Other denser but less costly alternatives in these applications include expanded clay, shale, slag, and slate. Alternate materials for loose-fill fireproofing insulation include fiberglass, perlite, and slag wool. In agriculture, substitutes include bark and other plant materials, peat, perlite, sawdust, and synthetic soil conditioners.'"
