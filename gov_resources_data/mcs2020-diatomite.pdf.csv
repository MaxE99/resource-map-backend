1000 MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'In 2019, production of diatomite was estimated to be 980,000 tons with an estimated processed value of $330 million, f.o.b. plant. Six companies produced diatomite at 12 mining areas and 9 processing facilities in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Approximately 60% of diatomite is used in filtration products. The remaining 40% is used in absorbents, fillers, lightweight aggregates, and other applications. A small amount, less than 1%, is used for specialized pharmaceutical and biomedical purposes. The unit value of diatomite varied widely in 2019, from approximately $10 per ton when used as a lightweight aggregate in portland cement concrete to more than $1,000 per ton for limited specialty markets, including art supplies, cosmetics, and DNA extraction.'",'None.',"'The amount of domestically produced diatomite sold or used by producers in 2019 increased slightly compared with that of 2018. Apparent domestic consumption increased slightly in 2019 to an estimated 920,000 tons; exports increased by an estimated 6%. The United States remained the leading global producer and consumer of diatomite. Filtration (including the purification of beer, liquors, and wine and the cleansing of greases and oils) continued to be the leading end use for diatomite, also known as diatomaceous earth. An important application for diatomite is the removal of microbial contaminants, such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses in public water systems. Other applications for diatomite include filtration of human blood plasma, pharmaceutical processing, and use as a nontoxic insecticide. Domestically, diatomite used in the production of cement was the second-ranked use. In 2019, the United States was the leading producer of diatomite, accounting for an estimated 34% of total world production, followed by Denmark and China with 15% each, Turkey with 6%, the Republic of Korea with 5%, Peru with 4%, and Mexico with 3%. Smaller quantities of diatomite were mined in 23 additional countries'","'Diatomite deposits form from an accumulation of amorphous hydrous silica cell walls of dead diatoms in oceanic and fresh waters. Diatomite is also known as kieselguhr (Germany), tripolite (after an occurrence near Tripoli, Libya), and moler (an impure Danish form). Because U.S. diatomite occurrences are at or near Earths surface, recovery from most deposits is achieved through low-cost, open pit mining. Outside the United States, however, underground mining is fairly common owing to deposit location and topographic constraints. World resources of crude diatomite are adequate for the foreseeable future.'","'Many materials can be substituted for diatomite. However, the unique properties of diatomite assure its continued use in many applications. Expanded perlite and silica sand compete for filtration. Filters made from manufactured materials, notably ceramic, polymeric, or carbon membrane filters and filters made with cellulose fibers, are becoming competitive as filter media. Alternate filler materials include clay, ground limestone, ground mica, ground silica sand, perlite, talc, and vermiculite. For thermal insulation, materials such as various clays, exfoliated vermiculite, expanded perlite, mineral wool, and special brick can be used. Transportation costs will continue to determine the maximum economic distance that most forms of diatomite may be shipped and still remain competitive with alternative materials.'"
