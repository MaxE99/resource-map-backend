1000 MT,,2018,2019.0,2019,"'Six lead mines in Missouri, plus five mines in Alaska, Idaho, and Washington that produced lead as a principal product or byproduct, accounted for all domestic lead mine production. The value of the lead in concentrates mined in 2019, based on the average North American Market price for refined lead, was about $630 million. Nearly all lead mine production has been exported since the last primary refinery closed in 2013. The 12 secondary refineries in 10 States accounted for more than 95% of the secondary lead produced in 2019. It was estimated that the lead-acid battery industry accounted for about 93% of reported U.S. lead consumption during 2019. Lead-acid batteries were primarily used as starting-lighting-ignition (SLI) batteries for automobiles, as industrial-type batteries for standby power for computer and telecommunications networks, and for motive power. During the first 9 months of 2019, 97 million lead-acid automotive batteries were shipped by North American producers, a 3% decrease from those shipped in the same period of 2018.'","'In 2019, about 1.2 million tons of secondary lead was produced, an amount equivalent to 73% of apparent domestic consumption. Nearly all secondary lead was recovered from old scrap, mostly lead-acid batteries.'","'During the first 11 months of 2019, the average LME cash price for lead was 91 cents per pound, 11% less than the average price in 2018. Global stocks of lead in LME-approved warehouses were 67,275 tons in mid-December 2019, which was 37% less than those at yearend 2018. In 2019, domestic mine production was estimated to be essentially unchanged from that in the previous year in all four lead-producing States. Production at one mine in Idaho continued to be relatively low owing to an employee strike, which began in March 2017. The United States has become more reliant on imported refined lead in recent years owing to the closure of the last primary lead smelter in 2013. In the first 10 months of 2019, 22.9 million spent SLI lead-acid batteries were exported, essentially unchanged compared with that in the same time period in 2018. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group,6 global refined lead production in 2019 decreased by 0.3% to 11.76 million tons, and metal consumption decreased by 0.5% to 11.81 million tons, resulting in a production-to- consumption deficit of about 50,000 tons of refined lead owing to the decline in automobile production and increased uses of lithium-ion batteries. '","'Identified world lead resources total more than 2 billion tons. In recent years, significant lead resources have been identified in association with zinc and (or) silver or copper deposits in Australia, China, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Russia, and the United States (Alaska).'",'Substitution by plastics has reduced the use of lead in cable covering and cans. Tin has replaced lead in solder for potable water systems. The electronics industry has moved toward lead-free solders and flat-panel displays that do not require lead shielding. Steel and zinc are common substitutes for lead in wheel weights.'
