1000 MT,,2019,2020,"'In 2020, recovered elemental sulfur and byproduct sulfuric acid were produced at 95 operations in 27 States. Total shipments were valued at about $320 million. Elemental sulfur production was estimated to be 7.6 million tons; Louisiana and Texas accounted for about 50% of domestic production. Elemental sulfur was recovered, in descending order of tonnage, at petroleum refineries, natural-gas-processing plants, and coking plants by 35 companies at 90 plants in 26 States. Byproduct sulfuric acid, representing about 6% of production of sulfur in all forms, was recovered at five nonferrous-metal smelters in four States by four companies. Domestic elemental sulfur provided 62% of domestic consumption, and byproduct sulfuric acid accounted for about 5%. The remaining 33% of sulfur consumed was provided by imported sulfur and sulfuric acid. About 90% of sulfur consumed was in the form of sulfuric acid.'","'Typically, between 2.5 million tons and 5 million tons of spent sulfuric acid is reclaimed from petroleum refining and chemical processes during any given year.'","'Total U.S. sulfur production in 2020 was estimated to have decreased by 7% from that of 2019, and shipments also decreased by 7% from those of 2019. Domestic production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refineries and recovery from natural gas operations decreased by 6%. Sulfur production decreased because of a decline in refinery capacity utilization as a result of decreased demand for refinery products owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic and processing of more sweet crude oil. Domestically, refinery sulfur production is expected to remain low as long as COVID-19 restrictions remain in place. Domestic byproduct sulfuric acid is expected to remain relatively constant, unless one or more of the remaining nonferrous-metal smelters close. Domestic phosphate rock consumption in 2020 was estimated to have remained the same as that in 2019, which resulted in the same consumption of sulfur to process the phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizers. World sulfur production was slightly less than it was in 2019 as a result of decreased demand resulting from global COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, but production is likely to increase steadily for the foreseeable future. New sulfur demand associated with phosphate fertilizer projects is expected mostly in Africa, but sulfur demand likely will increase in Asia and Eastern Europe. A major change for 2020 was the implementation of new international standards limiting sulfur oxide emissions from ocean-going ships on January 1, 2020. The global sulfur content limit of marine fuels was reduced to 0.5% from 3.5%, which is likely to lead to increased sulfur recovery from fuels in North America, Asia, and Europe. Contract sulfur prices in Tampa, FL, began 2020 at around $46 per long ton. The sulfur price decreased to $36 per long ton in mid-April, and then increased to $58 per long ton by the end of September. Fourth-quarter 2020 prices were set at $69 per long ton. The fourth-quarter price increase was a result of the decreased availability of sulfur owing to reduced output from natural gas and crude oil refining. In the past few years, sulfur prices have been variable, a result of the volatility in the demand for sulfur. '","'Resources of elemental sulfur in evaporite and volcanic deposits, and sulfur associated with natural gas, petroleum, tar sands, and metal sulfides, total about 5 billion tons. The sulfur in gypsum and anhydrite is almost limitless, and 600 billion tons of sulfur is contained in coal, oil shale, and shale that is rich in organic matter. Production from these sources would require development of low-cost methods of extraction. The domestic sulfur resource is about one-fifth of the world total.'","'Substitutes for sulfur at present or anticipated price levels are not satisfactory; some acids, in certain applications, may be substituted for sulfuric acid, but usually at a higher cost.'"
