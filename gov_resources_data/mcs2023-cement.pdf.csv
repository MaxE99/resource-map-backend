1000 MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,"'In 2022, U.S. portland cement production increased slightly to an estimated 92 million tons, and masonry cement production increased to an estimated 2.5 million tons. Cement was produced at 96 plants in 34 States, and at 2 plants in Puerto Rico. Texas, Missouri, California, and Florida were, in descending order of production, the four leading cement-producing States and accounted for approximately 43% of U.S. production. Overall, the U.S. cement industrys growth continued to be constrained by closed or idle plants, underutilized capacity at others, production disruptions from plant upgrades, and relatively inexpensive imports. In 2022, shipments of cement were estimated to have increased by about 3% from those in 2021 and were valued at $14.6 billion. In 2022, an estimated 70% to 75% of sales were to ready-mixed concrete producers, 11% to concrete product manufacturers, 8% to 10% to contractors, and 5% to 12% to other customer types. '","'Cement is not recycled, but significant quantities of concrete are recycled for use as a construction aggregate. Cement kilns can use waste fuels, recycled cement kiln dust, and recycled raw materials such as slags and fly ash. Various secondary materials can be incorporated as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in blended cements and in the cement paste in concrete.'","'The value of total construction put in place in the United States increased by 11% during the first 9 months of 2022 compared with that in the same period in 2021. Residential construction spending increased more than nonresidential construction spending. Despite increased prices owing to increased costs of production, cement shipments increased by about 4% during the first 9 months of 2022 compared with those in the same period in 2021. The leading cement-consuming States continued to be Texas, California, and Florida, in descending order by tonnage. Increased cement apparent consumption in 2022 resulted from continued economic recovery from the effects of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the November 2021 passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In 2022, regulators implemented new measures designed to aid industry decarbonization efforts, including green procurement strategies and research investments. However, cement industry growth continued to be constrained by increased costs for energy, material, and service inputs; labor and production shortages; and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Company merger-and-acquisition activity continued in 2022, including the sale of a United States-based cement companys plant in California to a Japan-based cement company. The Japanese cement company also entered into an agreement to purchase a second cement plant in California from the United States cement company, pending regulatory approval. Upgrades at a cement plant in Alabama were completed and the facility restarted production in mid-2022. An upgrade of a cement plant in Indiana progressed toward its expected completion date in early 2023. A plant upgrade to increase cement production at a site in Arizona was completed in 2022. Plans to increase capacity at a cement plant in Texas were announced, with completion expected in mid-2025. Upgrades at a terminal in Florida were completed in 2022, and work began to increase capacity at a terminal in Virginia. Plans for new cement terminals in Georgia and Texas were announced. Several minor upgrades were ongoing at some other domestic plants and a few other cement terminals. A Spain-based company reported plans to open a specialty cement facility in Louisiana in 2023. Numerous companies continued to make announcements aligned with the industrys commitment to sustainability, such as new blended cement product lines, renewable energy plans, decarbonization research initiatives, and other innovations. Following widespread acceptance of portland-limestone cement (PLC) blended cement by various authorities, several cement plants announced their transition to PLC (Type IL). Additionally, some plants reported increased alternative fuel substitution, new carbon capture, utilization and storage projects, usage of new technologies, and (or) business diversification efforts. Many plants have installed emissions-reduction equipment to comply with the 2010 National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). It remained possible that some kilns could be shut, idled, or used at reduced capacity to comply with NESHAP, which would constrain U.S. clinker capacity. In 2022, cement plant closures were announced at cement plants in California and New York.'",'See the Lime and Stone (Crushed) chapters for cement raw-material resources.',"'Most portland cement is used to make concrete, mortars, or stuccos, and competes in the construction sector with concrete substitutes, such as aluminum, asphalt, clay brick, fiberglass, glass, gypsum (plaster), steel, stone, and wood. Certain materials, especially fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag, develop good hydraulic cementitious properties by reacting with lime, such as that released by the hydration of portland cement. Where readily available (including as imports), these SCMs are increasingly being used as partial substitutes for portland cement in many concrete applications and are components of finished blended cements.'"
