1000 MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'The value of zinc mined in 2020, based on zinc contained in concentrate, was about $1.6 billion. Zinc was mined in five States at 14 mines operated by five companies. Three smelter facilities, one primary and two secondary, operated by three companies, produced commercial-grade zinc metal. Of the total reported zinc consumed, most was used in galvanizing, followed by brass and bronze, zinc-based alloys, and other uses.'","'In 2020, an estimated one-third of the refined zinc produced in the United States was recovered from secondary materials at both primary and secondary smelters. Secondary materials included galvanizing residues and crude zinc oxide recovered from electric arc furnace dust.'","'Global zinc mine production in 2020 was estimated to be 12 million tons, a 6% decrease from that of 2019. Government-mandated lockdowns and a decrease in zinc prices following the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in zinc mine production in many countries, particularly in South America. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group,8 global refined zinc production in 2020 was estimated to increase slightly to 13.60 million tons, and metal consumption was estimated decrease by 5% to 12.98 million tons, resulting in a production-to-consumption surplus of about 620,000 tons of refined zinc. Domestic zinc mine production decreased in 2020, owing partially to the closure of the Pend Oreille Mine in Washington State in 2019 after current reserves were exhausted and a decrease in production at the Red Dog Mine in Alaska related to the mining of lower grade ores after a change in the mine plan to manage water levels at the site. Refined zinc production increased after the reopening of an idled secondary zinc refinery in North Carolina in March. Apparent consumption of refined zinc decreased to an estimated 860,000 tons in 2020, consistent with a contraction in the domestic steel industry during the year as a result of the pandemic. The estimated annual average North American Special High Grade (SHG) zinc price decreased by 12% in 2020 from that in 2019 to $1.09 per pound.'","'"" Identified zinc resources of the world are about 1.9 billion tons.'","'Aluminum and plastics substitute for galvanized sheet in automobiles; aluminum alloys, cadmium, paint, and plastic coatings replace zinc coatings in other applications. Aluminum- and magnesium-base alloys are major competitors for zinc-base diecasting alloys. Many elements are substitutes for zinc in chemical, electronic, and pigment uses.'"
