MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'In 2022, one company recovered zircon (zirconium silicate) from surface-mining operations in Florida and Georgia as a coproduct from the mining of heavy-mineral sands and the processing of titanium and zirconium mineral concentrates, and a second company processed existing mineral sands tailings in Florida. Zirconium metal and hafnium metal were produced from zirconium chemical intermediates by one producer in Oregon and one in Utah. Zirconium and hafnium are typically contained in zircon at a ratio of about 36 to 1. Zirconium chemicals were produced by the metal producer in Oregon and by at least 10 other companies. Ceramics, foundry sand, opacifiers, and refractories were the leading end uses for zircon. Other end uses of zircon include abrasives, chemicals (predominantly zirconium basic sulfate and zirconium oxychloride octohydrate as intermediate chemicals), metal alloys, and welding rod coatings. The leading consumers of zirconium metal are the chemical process and nuclear energy industries. The leading use of hafnium metal is in superalloys.'",'Companies in Oregon and Utah recycled zirconium from new scrap generated during metal production and fabrication and (or) from post-commercial old scrap. Zircon foundry mold cores and spent or rejected zirconia',"'Global mine production of zirconium mineral concentrates increased slightly in 2022 compared with that in 2021. Advanced exploration and development projects with planned production of zircon concentrates were ongoing in Australia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania, and elsewhere. In the United States, mining and heavy-mineral-processing operations were expanded near Starke, FL, and at incorporated mobile mining units. Near Camden, TN, a pilot facility was commissioned at the Titan heavy-mineral-sands project to demonstrate mineral separations. U.S. imports and exports of zirconium ores and concentrates increased significantly in 2022. Australia, Senegal, and South Africa continued to be the leading import sources of zirconium ores and mineral concentrates. The leading global exporters of zirconium mineral concentrates were Australia, Senegal, and South Africa. The leading global importers were China, India, and Spain. Global producers of zirconium sponge included China, France, India, Russia, and the United States. The leading global exporters of zirconium metal including waste and scrap under the Harmonized System code 8109 were China, France, Germany, South Africa, and the United States. Vietnam and the United States led the global importers of zirconium metal'",'Resources of zircon in the United States included about 14 million tons associated with titanium resources in heavy-mineral-sand deposits. Phosphate rock and sand and gravel deposits could potentially yield substantial amounts of zircon as a byproduct. World resources of hafnium are associated with those of zircon and baddeleyite. Quantitative estimates of hafnium resources were not available.',"'Chromite and olivine can be used instead of zircon for some foundry applications. Dolomite and spinel refractories can also substitute for zircon in certain high-temperature applications. Niobium (columbium), stainless steel, and tantalum provide limited substitution in nuclear applications, and titanium and synthetic materials may substitute in some chemical processing plant applications. Silver-cadmium-indium control rods are used in lieu of hafnium at numerous nuclear powerplants. Zirconium can be used interchangeably with hafnium in certain superalloys.'"
