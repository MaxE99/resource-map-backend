1000 MT,,2019,2020,2019,2020,2019,2020,"'Production of clays (sold or used) in the United States was estimated to be 25 million tons valued at $1.6 billion in 2020, with about 125 companies operating clay and shale mines in 39 States. The leading 20 firms produced approximately 64% of the U.S. tonnage and 84% of the value for all types of clay. Principal uses for specific clays were estimated to be as follows: ball clay55% floor and wall tile and 18% sanitaryware; bentonite49% pet waste absorbents and 23% drilling mud; common clay43% brick, 30% lightweight aggregate, and 23% cement; fire clay77% heavy clay and lightweight aggregates products (for example, brick, cement, and concrete) and 23% refractory products and miscellaneous uses; fullers earth81% absorbents (includes oil and grease absorbents, pet waste absorbents and miscellaneous absorbents); and kaolin49% paper coating and filling, 10% refractory products, and 8% paint. Exports of clay and shale were estimated have decreased by 15% in 2020 after decreasing slightly in 2019. In 2020, the United States exported an estimated 760,000 tons of bentonite mainly for pet waste absorbent, drilling mud, foundry sand bond, and iron ore pelletizing applications, with Canada, Japan, and China being the leading destinations. About 1.9 million tons of kaolin were exported mainly as a paper coating and filler; a component in ceramic bodies; and fillers and extenders in paint, plastic, and rubber products, with China, Mexico, and Japan being the leading destinations. Lesser quantities of ball clay, fire clay, and fullers earth were exported for ceramic, refractory, and absorbent uses, respectively.'",'Insignificant.',"'As in recent years, U.S. sales of clay in 2020 continued to slightly decrease. Owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic, production of all types of clays, except for fullers earth, decreased in 2020. Housing construction decreased in the spring because of the pandemic, before rebounding during the latter part of the year. The percentage of new building construction using brick continues to decrease in favor of other materials.'",'* Resources of all clays are extremely large.',"'Clays compete with calcium carbonate in filler and extender applications; diatomite, organic pet litters, polymers, silica gel, and zeolites as absorbents; and various siding and roofing types in building construction.'"
