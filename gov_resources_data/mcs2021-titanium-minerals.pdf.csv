A second company processed existing mineral sands mine tailings in Florida and South Carolina. Based on reported data through October 2020, the estimated value of titanium mineral and synthetic concentrates imported into the United States was $520 million. Abrasive sands, monazite, and zircon were coproducts of domestic mining operations. About 90% of titanium mineral concentrates were consumed by domestic titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment producers. The remaining 10% was used in welding-rod coatings and for manufacturing carbides, chemicals, and titanium metal.","None. ","Consumption of titanium mineral concentrates is tied to production of TiO2 pigments that are primarily used in paint, paper, and plastics. Demand for these primary uses are tied to changes in the gross domestic product. Demand in the first half of 2020 decreased sharply owing to restrictions implemented to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In the second half of 2020, titanium producers reported that demand was recovering, led by demand for TiO2 in paints and coatings. Domestic apparent consumption of titanium mineral concentrates in 2020 was estimated to have decreased by about 30% from that of 2019; however, inventory changes were not included in this calculation. Although small compared with apparent consumption, exports of titanium mineral concentrates increased substantially from those in the previous year owing to increased exports to China, India, and the Netherlands. Australia, China, and South Africa were the leading producers of titanium mineral concentrates. China continued to be both the leading producer and consumer of titanium mineral concentrates. In 2020, Chinas imports of titanium mineral concentrates were about 3 million tons in gross weight, an increase of 19% compared with those in 2019. In Guangdong Province, capacity to produce up to 200,000 tons per year of synthetic rutile was being commissioned. As of October, Mozambique (36%), Australia (14%), Vietnam (11%), and Kenya (11%) were the leading sources of titanium mineral concentrates to China. In Saudi Arabia, owing to technical problems and COVID-19 pandemic concerns, commissioning of a project to produce up to 500,000 tons per year of titanium slag was delayed until 2021. Other projects were being developed in Australia, China, Malawi, Mozambique, Norway, Senegal, and Tanzania.","Ilmenite accounts for about 90% of the worlds consumption of titanium minerals. World resources of anatase, ilmenite, and rutile total more than 2 billion tons.","Ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, slag, and synthetic rutile compete as feedstock sources for producing TiO2 pigment, titanium metal, and welding-rod coatings."
