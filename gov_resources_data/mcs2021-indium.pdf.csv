MT,,2019,2020,"'Indium was not recovered from ores in the United States in 2020. Several companies produced indium productsincluding alloys, compounds, high-purity metal, and soldersfrom imported indium metal. Production of indium tin oxide (ITO) continued to account for most of global indium consumption. ITO thin-film coatings were primarily used for electrically conductive purposes in a variety of flat-panel displaysmost commonly liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Other indium end uses included alloys and solders, compounds, electrical components and semiconductors, and research. Based on an average of recent annual import levels, estimated domestic consumption of refined indium was 100 tons in 2020. The estimated value of refined indium consumed domestically in 2020, based on the average New York dealer price, was about $40 million.'","'Indium is most commonly recovered from ITO scrap in Japan and the Republic of Korea. A significant quantity of scrap was recycled domestically; however, data on the quantity of secondary indium recovered from scrap were not available.'","'The estimated average New York dealer price of indium was $400 per kilogram in 2020, a slight increase from that of 2019. The average monthly price was $390 per kilogram from January through April, and it increased to an average monthly price of $400 per kilogram from May through September. The 2020 estimated average duties unpaid in the warehouse, Rotterdam price of indium was $150 per kilogram, 19% less than in 2019. The average duties unpaid in the warehouse, Rotterdam price began the year at $138 per kilogram and increased throughout the year to an average of $162 per kilogram in September. On January 18, the Yunnan Provincial government sold 3,609 tons of indium that was held by the Fanya Metal Exchange that closed in 2015. The lot was offered by an auction process between January 17 and 18. The lot was purchased by the sole bidder for $416 million (2.65 billion yuan). The 3,609 tons of indium that was sold was equivalent to 4 years of global primary indium production. The leading producer of tin in China announced the launch of a production line for high-purity indium with a capacity of 5 tons per year. The line has the capacity to produced 6N- and 7N-grade metal. The company is also ramping up its indium tin oxide production after completing small-scale operations. '",'Indium is most commonly recovered from the zinc-sulfide ore mineral sphalerite. The indium content of zinc deposits from which it is recovered ranges from less than 1 part per million to 100 parts per million. Although the geochemical properties of indium are such that it occurs in trace amounts in other base-metal sulfides particularly chalcopyrite and stannitemost deposits of these minerals are subeconomic for indium recovery.',"'Antimony tin oxide coatings have been developed as an alternative to ITO coatings in LCDs and have been successfully annealed to LCD glass; carbon nanotube coatings have been developed as an alternative to ITO coatings in flexible displays, solar cells, and touch screens; poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has also been developed as a substitute for ITO in flexible displays and organic light-emitting diodes; and copper or silver nanowires have been explored as a substitute for ITO in touch screens. Graphene has been developed to replace ITO electrodes in solar cells and also has been explored as a replacement for ITO in flexible touch screens. Researchers have developed a more adhesive zinc oxide nanopowder to replace ITO in LCDs. Hafnium can replace indium in nuclear reactor control rod alloys.'"
