MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,"'Significant U.S. tantalum mine production has not been reported since 1959. Domestic tantalum resources are of low grade, some are mineralogically complex, and most are not commercially recoverable. Companies in the United States produced tantalum alloys, capacitors, carbides, compounds, and tantalum metal from imported tantalum ores and concentrates and tantalum-containing materials. Tantalum metal and alloys were recovered from foreign and domestic scrap. Domestic tantalum consumption was not reported by consumers. Major end uses for tantalum included alloys for gas turbines used in the aerospace and oil and gas industries; tantalum capacitors for automotive electronics, mobile phones, and personal computers; tantalum carbides for cutting and boring tools; and tantalum oxide (TazOs) was used in glass lenses to make lighter weight camera lenses that produce a brighter image. The value of tantalum consumed in 2021 was estimated to exceed $220 million as measured by the value of imports.'","'Tantalum was recycled mostly from new scrap that was generated during the manufacture of tantalum- containing electronic components and from tantalum-containing cemented carbide and superalloy scrap. The amount of tantalum recycled was not available, but it may be as much as 30% of apparent consumption.'","'U.S. tantalum apparent consumption (measured in contained tantalum) was estimated to have decreased by 11% from that in 2020. In 2021, estimated U.S. imports for consumption increased by 6%. Most of the tantalum imported was in the form of metal and powder (45%), followed by ores and concentrates (30%), and waste and scrap (24%). Waste and scrap imports saw the most significant variation by declining 37% from that in 2020. Estimated U.S. exports increased by 39% in 2021. In 2021, the average monthly price of tantalum ore remained constant at about $158 per kilogram of TazOs content between both years. Global tantalum production and consumption were thought to have increased in 2021 as steel production in most countries began to recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Production in Rwanda was estimated to have increased based on reported ore production through August 2021. China remained the leading export destination through the same period, accounting for approximately 30% of tantalum ores and concentrates, waste and scrap, and metals consumption. Brazil, Congo (Kinshasa), Nigeria, and Rwanda accounted for about 80% of estimated global tantalum production in 2021.'","'"" Identified world resources of tantalum, most of which are in Australia, Brazil, and Canada, are considered adequate to supply projected needs. The United States has about 55,000 tons of tantalum resources in identified deposits, most of which were considered uneconomical at 2021 prices for tantalum.'","'The following materials can be substituted for tantalum, but a performance loss or higher costs may ensue: niobium and tungsten in carbides; aluminum, ceramics, and niobium in electronic capacitors; glass, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, platinum, stainless steel, titanium, and zirconium in corrosion-resistant applications; and hafnium, iridium, molybdenum, niobium, rhenium, and tungsten in high-temperature applications.'"
