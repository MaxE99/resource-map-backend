MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'Significant U.S. niobium mine production has not been reported since 1959. Companies in the United States produced niobium-containing materials from imported niobium concentrates, oxides, and ferroniobium. Niobium was consumed mostly in the form of ferroniobium by the steel industry and as niobium alloys and metal by the aerospace industry. In 2020, there was a decrease in reported consumption of niobium for high-strength low-alloy steel and superalloy applications. Major end-use distribution of reported niobium consumption was as follows: steels, about 81%, and superalloys, about 19%. The estimated value of niobium consumption was $280 million, as measured by the value of imports.'","'Niobium was recycled when niobium-bearing steels and superalloys were recycled; scrap recovery, specifically for niobium content, was negligible. The amount of niobium recycled is not available, but it may be as much as 20% of apparent consumption.'","'Niobium principally was imported in the form of ferroniobium. Based on data through August 2020, U.S. niobium apparent consumption (measured in contained niobium) for 2020 was estimated to be 6,900 tons, a 26% decrease from that of 2019. Brazil continued to be the worlds leading niobium producer with 91% of global production, followed by Canada with 8%. Significant production decreases by major aircraft manufacturers reduced niobium consumption for superalloys. Global niobium production and consumption was thought to have decreased in 2020 owing to a decrease in steel production in most countries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant decrease in ferrovanadium prices in 2020 was also a factor in reduced ferroniobium consumption. In 2019, consumption of ferroniobium, especially in China, had increased in part because it was used as a substitute for ferrovanadium by some producers of high-strength low-alloy steel owing to the supply deficit and high price volatility of ferrovanadium. In the first 9 months of 2020, Chinas imports of ferrovanadium increased by 700% while ferroniobium imports decreased by 36% compared with those in the same period of 2019, suggesting that some reverse substitution was taking place. Total exports of ferroniobium to all countries from Brazil, the leading producing country, decreased by 35% during the first 9 months of 2020 compared with exports during the same period of 2019. One domestic company developing its Elk Creek project in Nebraska announced that it had secured options to purchase all the land needed for the mine and processing facility. The company received its construction air permit from the State of Nebraska in June. The project would be the only niobium mine and primary niobium processing facility in the United States, with construction to begin after financing was obtained. A leading niobium producer in Brazil was in the process of increasing its annual ferroniobium production capacity by 50% to 150,000 tons per year (approximately 98,000 tons per year of contained niobium). Originally expected by the end of 2020, the expansion was to be completed in 2021.'",' World resources of niobium are more than adequate to supply projected needs. Most of the worlds identified resources of niobium occur as pyrochlore in carbonatite (igneous rocks that contain more than 50%-by-volume carbonate minerals) deposits and are outside the United States.',"'The following materials can be substituted for niobium, but a performance loss or higher cost may ensue: ceramic matrix composites, molybdenum, tantalum, and tungsten in high-temperature (superalloy) applications; molybdenum, tantalum, and titanium as alloying elements in stainless and high-strength steels; and molybdenum and vanadium as alloying elements in high-strength low-alloy steels.'"
