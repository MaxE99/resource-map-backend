MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'Byproduct vanadium production in Utah from the mining of uraniferous sandstones on the Colorado Plateau ceased in the first quarter of 2020 owing to decreasing vanadium prices. An estimated 70 tons of contained vanadium with an estimated value of $1.4 million was produced in 2020. Secondary vanadium production continued primarily in Arkansas, Delaware, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas, where processed waste materials (petroleum residues, spent catalysts, utility ash, and vanadium-bearing pig iron slag) were used to produce ferrovanadium, vanadium-bearing chemicals or specialty alloys, vanadium metal, and vanadium pentoxide. Metallurgical use, primarily as an alloying agent for iron and steel, accounted for about 94% of domestic reported vanadium consumption in 2020. Of the other uses for vanadium, the major nonmetallurgical use was in catalysts to produce maleic anhydride and sulfuric acid. '",'The quantity of vanadium recycled from spent chemical process catalysts was significant and may compose as much as 40% of total vanadium catalysts.',"'U.S. apparent consumption of vanadium in 2020 decreased by 35% from that of 2019. Among the major uses for vanadium, production of carbon, full-alloy, and high-strength low-alloy steels accounted for 18%, 45%, and 33%, respectively, of domestic consumption. The estimated average Chinese vanadium pentoxide price in 2020 decreased by 45% compared with the 2019 price, and the estimated United States ferrovanadium price decreased by 53% to $10.40 per pound in 2020 compared with that in 2019. The implementation of the new high-strength rebar standards by the Standardization Administration of China continued to be enforced inconsistently. Larger mills in China began implementation in 2018; however, smaller mills have been slower to implement the new rebar standards. In addition, substitution of ferroniobium for ferrovanadium has caused lasting effects on mills, and mills were unlikely to switch back to using ferrovanadium owing to costly technical changes already incurred. A vanadium processing facility in South Africa reopened in early 2020 under new management and began processing stockpiled materials. A producer in Brazil that started production in 2014 continued to be on track to reach vanadium production guidance for 2020 despite production delays caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, some vanadium producers have reported that they were unlikely to reach their original anticipated production guidance and were unsure of the continuing effects of the pandemic.'","'World resources of vanadium exceed 63 million tons. Vanadium occurs in deposits of phosphate rock, titaniferous magnetite, and uraniferous sandstone and siltstone, in which it constitutes less than 2% of the host rock. Significant quantities are also present in bauxite and carboniferous materials, such as coal, crude oil, oil shale, and tar sands. Because vanadium is typically recovered as a byproduct or coproduct, demonstrated world resources of the element are not fully indicative of available supplies. Although domestic resources and secondary recovery are adequate to supply a large portion of domestic needs, almost all of U.S. demand is currently met by foreign sources.'","'Steels containing various combinations of other alloying elements can be substituted for steels containing vanadium. Certain metals, such as manganese, molybdenum, niobium (columbium), titanium, and tungsten, are to some degree interchangeable with vanadium as alloying elements in steel. Platinum and nickel can replace vanadium compounds as catalysts in some chemical processes. Currently, no acceptable substitute for vanadium is available for use in aerospace titanium alloys.'"
