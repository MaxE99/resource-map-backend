1000 MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,"'In 2022, three companies operated six primary aluminum smelters in five States. Two of these six smelters operated at full capacity throughout the year. The other four smelters operated at reduced capacity and one of these four smelters began a temporary shutdown in June. A seventh smelter remained on standby throughout the year. Domestic smelters were operating at about 52% of capacity of 1.64 million tons per year at yearend 2022. Estimated primary production decreased by 3% compared with that in 2021 but estimated secondary production from new and old scrap increased by 3% compared with that in 2021. Based on published prices, the value of primary aluminum production was about $2.90 billion, 7% more than the $2.71 billion in 2021. The average annual U.S. market price increased by about 8% from that in 2021. Transportation applications accounted for 35% of domestic consumption; the remainder was used in packaging, 23%; building, 16%; electrical, 10%; machinery, 7%; consumer durables, 6%; and other, 3%.'","'In 2022, aluminum recovered from purchased scrap in the United States was about 3.4 million tons, of which about 56% came from new (manufacturing) scrap and 44% from old scrap (discarded aluminum products). Aluminum recovered from old scrap was equivalent to about 29% of apparent consumption.'","'In June, a 250,000-ton-per-year primary aluminum smelter in Hawesville, KY, idled its full production for an estimated 9 to 12 months owing to high energy costs. In July, a 161,000-ton-per-year primary aluminum smelter in Newburgh, IN, curtailed one of three operating aluminum smelting lines, citing operational challenges. In July, force majeure was declared at a rolling mill and aluminum packaging products manufacturer in Newburgh, IN, that produced approximately 310,000 tons per year of rolled aluminum. A shortage of magnesium, an essential component of aluminum packaging products, was cited for the declaration. Production at the plant was reduced by up to 50% before the declaration was lifted in September. In August, low local demand led to the permanent closure of aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities in Phoenix, AZ, and St. Paul, MN. In October, construction began on a $2.5 billion aluminum recycling and rolling plant in Bay Minette, AL. When completed in 2025, the plant was expected to produce 600,000 tons per year of finished products, including beverage cans. Prices for aluminum increased through March, then generally trended downward throughout 2022 in the United States and in world markets. In June, a tariff-rate quota system began that exempted certain aluminum imports from the United Kingdom from the 10% tariff imposed since 2018 under the authority of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The quota system consisted of quantity limits during two periods in 2022 and the requirement that imports of aluminum articles be accompanied by a certificate of analysis for the smelted primary aluminum contained within in the articles. To be eligible for the tariff exemption, imports could not contain primary aluminum from Belarus, China, or Russia. In April, a 447,000-ton-per-year primary aluminum smelter in Sao Luis, Brazil, restarted operations with full production expected by yearend. Several European aluminum producers announced production curtailments owing to high energy costs. In August, a 175,000-ton-per-year primary aluminum smelter in Slovakia ceased production, and a 94,000-ton-per-year primary aluminum smelter in Norway curtailed operation of a single potline. In September, a 70,000-ton-per-year primary aluminum smelter in Germany reduced production by 50%, and a 290,000-ton-per-year primary aluminum smelter in France reduced production by 22%. By yearend, a Norwegian primary aluminum smelter reduced production across two facilities by 110,000 to 130,000 tons per year. These facilities have annual capacities of 197,000 tons per year and 270,000 tons per year of primary aluminum. '",'Global resources of bauxite are estimated to be between 55 billion and 75 billion tons and are sufficient to meet world demand for metal well into the future.',"'Composites can substitute for aluminum in aircraft fuselages and wings. Glass, paper, plastics, and steel can substitute for aluminum in packaging. Composites, magnesium, steel, and titanium can substitute for aluminum in ground transportation uses. Composites, steel, vinyl, and wood can substitute for aluminum in construction. Copper can replace aluminum in electrical and heat-exchange applications.'"
