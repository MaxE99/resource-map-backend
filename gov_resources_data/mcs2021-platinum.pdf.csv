kg,,2019,2020,2019,2020,2020.0,"'One company in Montana produced approximately 18,000 kilograms of platinum- group metals (PGMs) with an estimated value of about $1.1 billion. Small quantities of primary PGMs also were recovered as byproducts of copper-nickel mining in Michigan; however, this material was sold to foreign companies for refining. The leading domestic use for PGMs was in catalytic converters to decrease harmful emissions from automobiles. PGMs are also used in catalysts for bulk-chemical production and petroleum refining; dental and medical devices; electronic applications, such as in computer hard disks, hybridized integrated circuits, and multilayer ceramic capacitors; glass manufacturing; investment; jewelry; and laboratory equipment.'","'About 102,000 kilograms of palladium and platinum was recovered globally from new and old scrap in 2020, including about 57,000 kilograms recovered from automobile catalytic converters in the United States.'","'Progress continued at a domestic mine expansion project; full production from the project was expected by late 2021. Production of PGMs in South Africa, the worlds leading supplier of mined material, decreased by 11% compared with that of 2019 owing to temporary lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increased labor costs, increased costs for electricity, an unreliable supply of electricity, and challenges related to deep-level mining. The estimated annual average prices of iridium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium increased by 5%, 38%, 136%, and slightly, respectively, compared with those of 2019. The estimated average annual price of platinum decreased slightly compared with that of 2019, continuing a 5-year trend of declining prices. The price of palladium remained higher than that of platinum in 2020, with palladium prices exceeding a previous high of $1,977.00 in December 2019. '","""'World resources of PGMs are estimated to total more than 100 million kilograms. The largest reserves are in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa.""","'Palladium has been substituted for platinum in most gasoline-engine catalytic converters because of the historically lower price for palladium relative to that of platinum. About 25% of palladium can routinely be substituted for platinum in diesel catalytic converters; the proportion can be as much as 50% in some applications. For some industrial end uses, one PGM can substitute for another, but with losses in efficiency.'"
