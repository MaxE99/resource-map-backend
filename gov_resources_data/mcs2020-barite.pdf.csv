1000 MT,,2018,2019,2019.0,"'In 2019, domestic mine production increased by approximately 6%, to an estimated 390,000 tons valued at an estimated $44 million. Most of the production came from Nevada and a single mine in Georgia. An estimated 2.5 million tons of barite (from domestic production and imports) was sold by crushers and grinders operating in seven States. The United States is the worlds leading barite consumer, with more than 90% of the barite sold in the United States used as a weighting agent in fluids used in the drilling of oil and natural gas wells. The majority of Nevada crude barite was ground in Nevada and then sold to companies drilling in the Central and Western United States. Offshore drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore drilling operations in other regions primarily used imported barite. Barite also is used as a filler, extender, or weighting agent in products such as paints, plastics, and rubber. Some specific applications include use in automobile brake and clutch pads, automobile paint primer for metal protection and gloss, use as a weighting agent in rubber, and in the cement jacket around underwater petroleum pipelines. In the metal-casting industry, barite is part of the mold-release compounds. Because barite significantly blocks x-ray and gamma-ray emissions, it is used as aggregate in high-density concrete for radiation shielding around x-ray units in hospitals, nuclear powerplants, and university nuclear research facilities. Ultrapure barite is used as a contrast medium in x-ray and computed tomography examinations of the gastrointestinal tract.'",'None.',"'Although the U.S. monthly average count of active rigs dropped throughout 2019, sales of ground barite were estimated to have increased slightly. Nearly one-half of sales were from plants in Texas, reflecting increased domestic drilling activity, which has been concentrated in the Permian Basin in recent years. Beginning in the 1980s, China emerged as the worlds leading producer of barite and the United States has been its leading customer. Although that remains true, in recent years, owing partially to industry consolidation and increased barite consumption in China, domestic consumers have diversified import sources. A higher percentage of United States imports has been supplied by other leading exporting countries such as India and Morocco. This trend has also apparently stimulated increased production and exports in other countries, particularly Laos and Mexico.   Beginning in 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau reported increased quantities of barite imports from Vietnam. However, imports from Vietnam were more likely mined in Laos, where a new mine reportedly exported ore through the Port of Cua Lo in Vietnam. Domestic grinding plants reported importing more than 100,000 tons of barite from Laos in 2018 and, in 2019, this quantity was estimated to have increased to approximately 300,000 tons.  Production increases in Mexico in recent years corresponded with increased truck and rail shipments to key drilling areas in the Permian Basin. Most barite imports have been crude barite, which was processed at domestic grinding plants but, in 2019, an increasing proportion of barite from Mexico was reportedly ground barite shipped to warehouses or to onshore drilling sites.'","'In the United States, identified resources of barite are estimated to be 150 million tons, and undiscovered resources contribute an additional 150 million tons. The worlds barite resources in all categories are about 2 billion tons, but only about 740 million tons are identified resources. However, no known systematic assessment of either U.S. or global barite resources has been conducted since the 1980s.'","'In the drilling mud market, alternatives to barite include celestite, ilmenite, iron ore, and synthetic hematite that is manufactured in Germany. None of these substitutes, however, has had a major impact on the barite drilling mud industry.'"
