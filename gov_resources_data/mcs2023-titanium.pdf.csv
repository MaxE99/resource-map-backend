MT,,2021,2022,2021,2022,"'Titanium sponge metal was produced by one operation in Utah. Production data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The facility in Salt Lake City, UT, with an estimated capacity of 500 tons per year, produced titanium that was further refined for use in electronics. A second sponge facility in Henderson, NV, with an estimated capacity of 12,600 tons per year, was idled since 2020 owing to market conditions. A third facility, in Rowley, UT, with an estimated capacity of 10,900 tons per year, has remained on care- and-maintenance status since 2016. Although detailed 2022 consumption data were withheld to avoid disclosing proprietary data, the majority of titanium metal was used in aerospace applications, and the remainder was used in armor, chemical processing, marine hardware, medical implants, power generation, and consumer other applications. The value of imported sponge was about $250 million, a significant increase compared with $148 million in 2021. In 2022, titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment production, by four companies operating five facilities in four States, was valued at about $3.4 billion. The leading uses of TiO2 pigment were, in descending order, paints (including lacquers and varnishes), plastics, and paper. Other uses of TiO2 pigment included catalysts, ceramics, coated fabrics and textiles, floor coverings, printing ink, and roofing granules.'","'Owing to limited responses from voluntary surveys, consumption data of titanium scrap metal for the titanium metal industry were withheld. Consumption data of titanium scrap for the steel, superalloy, and other industries were not available.'","'The 500-ton-per-year Salt Lake City, UT, plant was the only active domestic producer of titanium sponge, and the Salt Lake City operations primarily supported the production of electronic-grade materials. Consequently, U.S. producers of titanium ingot and downstream products were reliant on imports of titanium sponge and scrap. Rebounding demand from the aerospace and other industries resulted in a 75% increase in imports of titanium sponge compared with those in 2021. Japan (82%), Kazakhstan (9%), and Saudi Arabia (7%) were the leading import sources for titanium sponge in 2022. U.S. imports of titanium scrap were about 17,000 tons. The United Kingdom and Germany (14% each), France (11%), Canada (10%), and Japan (9%) were the leading import sources for titanium waste and scrap in 2022. In 2022, the annual average duty-paid unit value of scrap imports was about $7.50 per kilogram compared with $4.80 per kilogram in 2021. In 2022, several companies were planning to expand domestic downstream production capacity. In Pennsylvania, one company was adding 7,300 metric tons per year of ingot melting capacity as well as additional forging capabilities. Another company planned to construct a new melt facility in West Virginia, although the annual capacity was not yet available. A third company expected to complete an initial 125 tons per year of titanium powder capacity using new technology and recycled metal feedstock. Following the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, major European and domestic aerospace consumers of titanium were seeking alternative sources of supply. Prior to the conflict, Ukraine was the leading source of titanium mineral concentrates suppling Russias titanium metal industry. Domestic production of TiO2 pigment in 2022 was an estimated 1.1 million tons. Although heavily reliant on imports of titanium mineral concentrates, the United States was a net exporter of TiO2 pigments. Exports of TiO2 pigments decreased in 2022 while imports increased.'",'Resources of titanium minerals are discussed in the Titanium Mineral Concentrates chapter.',"'Few materials possess titanium metals strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. In high- strength applications, titanium competes with aluminum, composites, intermetallics, steel, and superalloys. Aluminum, nickel, specialty steels, and zirconium alloys may be substituted for titanium for applications that require corrosion resistance. Ground calcium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate, kaolin, and talc compete with titanium dioxide as a white pigment.'"
