1000 MT,,2019,2020,"'Six companies produced silicon materials in 2020, all east of the Mississippi River. Most ferrosilicon was consumed in the ferrous foundry and steel industries, predominantly in the Eastern United States, and was sourced primarily from domestic quartzite (silica). The main consumers of silicon metal were producers of aluminum alloys and the chemical industry, in particular for the manufacture of silicones. The semiconductor and solar energy industries, which manufacture chips for computers and photovoltaic cells from high- purity silicon, respectively, also consumed silicon metal.'",'Insignificant.',"'Combined domestic ferrosilicon and silicon metal production in 2020, expressed in terms of contained silicon, decreased from that of 2019. One producer shut down its ferrosilicon production facility on July 1 owing to decreased demand and lower pricesin part because of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as competition from lower priced imported ferrosilicon. Domestic production during the first 8 months of 2020 was about 11% less, on a contained-weight basis, than that during the same period in 2019. By August 2020, average U.S. ferrosilicon spot market prices had increased slightly for 50%-grade ferrosilicon and decreased slightly for 75%-grade ferrosilicon compared with those in 2019; the average silicon metal spot market price had decreased by 10% compared with the annual average spot price in 2019. Excluding the United States, ferrosilicon accounted for about 64% of world silicon production on a silicon-content basis in 2020. The leading countries for ferrosilicon production were, in descending order and on a contained-weight basis, China, Russia, and Norway. For silicon metal, the leading producers were China, Brazil, Norway, and France. China accounted for approximately 68% of total global estimated production of silicon materials in 2020. Global production of silicon materials, on a contained weight basis, was estimated to be about 5% less than that in 2019. Steel production, the leading use of ferrosilicon, decreased across the globe in 2020 compared with production in 2019 owing to reduced demand attributed to the global COVID-19 pandemic. '","' World and domestic resources for making silicon metal and alloys are abundant and, in most producing countries, adequate to supply world requirements for many decades. The source of the silicon is silica in various natural forms, such as quartzite.'","'Aluminum, silicon carbide, and silicomanganese can be substituted for ferrosilicon in some applications. Gallium arsenide and germanium are the principal substitutes for silicon in semiconductor and infrared applications.'"
