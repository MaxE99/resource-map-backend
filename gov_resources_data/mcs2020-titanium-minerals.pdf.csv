In August, the owner of the operation in Florida acquired the operations in Georgia. A third (separate) company processed existing mineral sands tailings in Florida. Based on reported data through October 2019, the estimated value of titanium mineral and synthetic concentrates imported into the United States in 2019 was $840 million. Zircon was a coproduct of mining from ilmenite and rutile deposits. About 90% of titanium mineral concentrates were consumed by domestic titanium dioxide (TiOz) pigment producers. The remaining 10% was used in welding-rod coatings and for manufacturing carbides, chemicals, and titanium metal.'",'None.',"'Consumption of titanium mineral concentrates is tied to production of TiOz2 pigments that are primarily used in paint, paper, and plastics. Domestic apparent consumption of titanium mineral concentrates in 2019 was estimated to have increased by about 16% from that of 2018. Exports in 2019 decreased substantially from those in the previous year because of a large intracompany transfer of inventory to Australia from Virginia in 2018. In Australia, mining was restarting at the Jacinth-Ambrosia Mine in South Australia. In Greenland, a prefeasibility study was completed on the Dundas mining project on the northwestern coast of Greenland. Production capacity of up to 440,000 tons per year of ilmenite concentrate was planned to be commissioned by 2021 contingent upon approval of a mining license. China continued to be the leading producer and consumer of titanium mineral concentrates. In Saudi Arabia, a project to produce up to 500,000 tons per year of titanium slag was scheduled to be commissioned in 2020. Other projects were being developed in Australia, Mozambique, and Tanzania.'",'Ilmenite accounts for about 89% of the worlds consumption of titanium minerals. World resources',"'Ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, slag, and synthetic rutile compete as feedstock sources for producing TiOz'"
