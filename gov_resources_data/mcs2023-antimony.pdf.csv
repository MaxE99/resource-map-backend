MT,,2021,2022,2022,"In 2022, no marketable antimony was mined in the United States. A mine in Nevada that had extracted about 800 tons of stibnite ore from 2013 through 2014 was placed on care-and-maintenance status in 2015 and had no reported production in 2022. Primary antimony metal and oxide were produced by one company in Montana using imported feedstock. Secondary antimony production was derived mostly from antimonial lead recovered from spent lead-acid batteries. The estimated value of secondary antimony produced in 2022 was about $60 million. Recycling supplied about 15% of estimated domestic consumption, and the remainder came mostly from imports. In the United States, the leading uses of antimony were as follows: flame retardants, 40%; metal products, including antimonial lead and ammunition, 36%; and nonmetal products, including ceramics and glass and rubber products, 24%.","The bulk of secondary antimony is recovered at secondary lead smelters as antimonial lead, most of which was generated by, and then consumed by, the lead-acid battery industry.",China continued to be the leading global antimony producer in 2022 and accounted for 55% of global mine production. The supply of antimony raw materials and downstream production of antimony products was constrained in 2022 as a result of various temporary mine shutdowns to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The antimony price reached a high of $7.03 per pound in March 2022 and the estimated average price was $6.30 per pound in 2022 compared with the annual average price of $5.31 per pound in 2021.,"U.S. resources of antimony are mainly in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada. Principal identified world resources are in Australia, Bolivia, Burma, China, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Tajikistan. Additional antimony resources may occur in Mississippi Valley-type lead deposits in the Eastern United States.","Selected organic compounds and hydrated aluminum oxide are substitutes as flame retardants. Chromium, tin, titanium, zinc, and zirconium compounds substitute for antimony chemicals in enamels, paint, and pigments. Combinations of calcium, copper, selenium, sulfur, and tin are substitutes for alloys in lead-acid batteries."
