MT,,2018,2019,2019.0,"'Tin has not been mined or smelted in the United States since 1993 and 1989, respectively. Twenty-five firms accounted for over 90% of the primary tin consumed domestically in 2019. The major uses for tin in the United States were tinplate, 21%; chemicals, 17%; solder, 14%; alloys, 10%; babbitt, brass and bronze, and tinning, 11%; and other, 27%. Based on the average Platts Metals Week New York dealer price for tin, the estimated value of imported refined tin in 2019 was $703 million, and the estimated value of tin recovered from old scrap domestically in 2019 was $213 million.'","'About 11,000 tons of tin from old and new scrap was estimated to have been recycled in 2019. Of this, about 10,000 tons was recovered from old scrap at 2 detinning plants and about 75 secondary nonferrous metal- processing plants, accounting for 24% of apparent consumption.'","'Apparent consumption of tin in the United States was estimated to have decreased by 6% in 2019 compared with consumption in 2018. Indonesia was the leading supplier of refined tin and Canada was the leading supplier of tin waste and scrap to the United States in 2019. The estimated amount of tin recycled in 2019 decreased slightly compared with that in 2018. Estimated annual average tin prices based on the first 9 months in 2019 were 860 and 840 cents per pound for the New York dealer price and London Metal Exchange cash price, respectivelyan 8% decrease for both prices from those in 2018. In 2019, the monthly average New York dealer tin price peaked in March at 992 cents per pound, then steadily decreased through August to a monthly average price of 776 cents per pound, where monthly average prices remained essentially unchanged through October.'","'Identified resources of tin in the United States, primarily in Alaska, were insignificant compared with those of the rest of the world. World resources, principally in western Africa, southeastern Asia, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, and Russia, are extensive and, if developed, could sustain recent annual production rates well into the future.'","'Aluminum, glass, paper, plastic, or tin-free steel substitute for tin content in cans and containers. Other materials that substitute for tin are epoxy resins for solder; aluminum alloys, alternative copper-base alloys, and plastics for bronze; plastics for bearing metals that contain tin; and compounds of lead and sodium for some tin chemicals.'"
