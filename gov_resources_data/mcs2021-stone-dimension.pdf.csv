1000 MT,,2019.0,2020.0,"'Approximately 2.6 million tons of dimension stone, valued at $400 million, was sold or used by U.S. producers in 2020. Dimension stone was produced by around 200 companies operating 250 quarries in 34 States. Leading producing States were, in descending order by tonnage, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, Vermont, and New York. These five States accounted for about 71% of the production quantity and contributed about 61% of the value of domestic production. Approximately 50%, by tonnage, of dimension stone sold or used was limestone, followed by sandstone (19%), granite (17%), dolomite (4%), miscellaneous stone (3%), and the remaining 7% was divided, in descending order of tonnage, among slate, marble, quartzite, and traprock. By value, the leading sales or uses were for limestone (46%), followed by granite (25%), sandstone (11%), slate (5%), marble (4%), dolomite (4%), and the remaining 5% was divided, in descending order of total value, among quartzite, traprock, and miscellaneous stone. Rough stone represented 54% of the tonnage and 47% of the value of all the dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, including exports. The leading uses and distribution of rough stone, by tonnage, were in building and construction (53%) and in irregular-shaped stone (35%). The leading uses and distribution of dressed stone, by tonnage, were in ashlars and partially squared pieces (41%), slabs and blocks for building and construction (12%), and curbing (11%).'","'Small amounts of dimension stone were recycled, principally by restorers of old stone work.'","'The United States remained one of the worlds leading markets for dimension stone. In 2020, total imports of dimension stone decreased in value by about 15% compared with the value in 2019. In 2020, increased demand for dimension stone for construction and refurbishment used in residential markets helped offset decreases in commercial markets. Both markets were affected because of the measures instituted to mitigate the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic. These measures also led to increases in the home remodeling sector, with companies reporting a 40% to 50% increase in demand for remodeling projects. Dimension stone exports decreased to about $47 million. Apparent consumption, by value, was estimated to be $2.0 billion in 2020a 13% decrease compared with that of 2019. The dimension stone industry continued to be concerned with safety and health regulations and environmental restrictions in 2020, especially those concerning crystalline silica exposure. Beginning in 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) finalized new regulations to further restrict exposure to crystalline silica at quarry sites and other industries that use materials containing it. Phased implementation of the new regulations was scheduled to take effect through 2021, affecting various industries that use materials containing silica. Most provisions of the new regulations became enforceable on June 23, 2018, for general industry and maritime operations.'",'Dimension stone resources of the world are sufficient. Resources can be limited on a local level or occasionally on a regional level by the lack of a particular kind of stone that is suitable for dimension purposes.',"'Substitutes for dimension stone include aluminum, brick, ceramic tile, concrete, glass, plastics, resin- agglomerated stone, and steel.'"
