MT,,2019,"In 2019, no rubidium was mined in the United States; however, occurrences are known in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, South Dakota, and Utah. Rubidium is also associated with some evaporate mineral occurrences in other States. Rubidium is not a major constituent of any mineral. Rubidium concentrate is produced as a byproduct of pollucite (cesium) and lepidolite (lithium) mining and is imported from other countries for processing in the United States. Applications for rubidium and its compounds include biomedical research, electronics, specialty glass, and pyrotechnics. Specialty glasses are the leading market for rubidium; rubidium carbonate is used to reduce electrical conductivity, which improves stability and durability in fiber optic telecommunications networks. Biomedical applications include rubidium salts used in antishock agents and the treatment of epilepsy and thyroid disorder; rubidium-82, a radioactive isotope used as a blood-flow tracer in positron emission tomographic imaging; and rubidium chloride, used as an antidepressant. Rubidium atoms are used in academic research, including the development of quantum-mechanics-based computing devices, a future application with potential for relatively high consumption of rubidium. Quantum computing research uses ultracold rubidium atoms in a variety of applications. Quantum computers, which have the ability to perform more complex computational tasks than traditional computers by calculating in two quantum states simultaneously, were expected to be in prototype phase by 2025. Rubidiums photoemissive properties make it useful for electrical-signal generators in motion-sensor devices, night- vision devices, photoelectric cells (solar panels), and photomultiplier tubes. Rubidium is used as an atomic resonance-frequency-reference oscillator for telecommunications network synchronization, playing a vital role in global positioning systems. Rubidium-rich feldspars are used in ceramic applications for spark plugs and electrical insulators because of their high dielectric constant. Rubidium hydroxide is used in fireworks to oxidize mixtures of other elements and produce violet hues. The U.S. military frequency standard, the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) timescale, is based on 48 weighted atomic clocks, including 4 USNO rubidium fountain clocks.",None.,"Domestic rubidium occurrences will remain uneconomic unless market conditions change, such as the development of new end uses or increased consumption for existing end uses, which in turn could lead to increased prices. No known human health issues are associated with exposure to naturally occurring rubidium, and its use has minimal environmental impact. During 2019, projects that were primarily aimed at developing lithium resources were at various stages of development, including eight subprojects at the King Col project in Australia, the Jubilee Lake lithium prospect in Canada, the Soris lithium project in Namibia, and the Winnipeg River pegmatite field in Canada. The status of these projects ranged from early feasibility studies to active exploration and drilling. No production has been reported at any sites. The projects focused on pegmatites containing pollucite and spodumene, which primarily contain lithium, tantalum, or both, but may also contain minor quantities of cesium and rubidium.","Significant rubidium-bearing pegmatite occurrences have been identified in the United States, Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Peru, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Zambia. Minor quantities of rubidium are reported in brines in northern Chile and China and in evaporites in the United States (New Mexico and Utah), France, and Germany.","Rubidium and cesium can be used interchangeably in many applications because they have similar physical properties and atomic radii. Cesium, however, is more electropositive than rubidium, making it a preferred material for some applications."
