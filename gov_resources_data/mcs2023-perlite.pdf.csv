1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'In 2022, the quantity of domestic processed crude perlite sold and used was estimated to be 520,000 tons with a value of $34 million. Crude ore production was from nine mines operated by six companies in six Western States. New Mexico continued to be the leading producing State. Domestic apparent consumption of crude perlite was estimated to be 720,000 tons. Processed crude perlite was expanded at 51 plants in 27 States. The applications for expanded perlite were building construction products, 44%; horticultural aggregate, 19%; fillers, 15%; filter aids, 14%; and other, 8%. Other applications included specialty insulation and miscellaneous uses.'",'Not available.',"'Perlite is a siliceous volcanic glass that expands up to 20 times its original volume when rapidly heated. In horticultural uses, expanded perlite is used to provide moisture retention and aeration without compaction when added to soil. Horticultural perlite is useful to both commercial growers and hobby gardeners. Owing primarily to cost, some commercial greenhouse growers in the United States have recently switched to a wood fiber material instead of perlite. Perlite, however, remained a preferred soil amendment for segments of greenhouse growers because it does not degrade or compact over lengthy growing times and is inert. Construction applications for expanded perlite are numerous because it is fire resistant, an excellent insulator, and lightweight. Novel and small markets for perlite have increased during the past 10 years; cosmetics, environmental remediation, and personal care products have become increasing markets for perlite. The value of total construction put in place in the United States increased by about 11% during the first 6 months of 2022 compared with that of the same period in 2021, indicating a similar change in consumption of perlite. Construction products remained the largest domestic market for perlite. Increased interest in commercial greenhouse and hobby gardening may also correspond to increased consumption of horticultural-grade perlite. Based on estimated world production for 2022, the worlds leading producers were, in descending order of production, China, Turkey, Greece, and the United States, accounting for about 35%, 26%, 17%, and 12%, respectively, of world production. Although China was the leading producer, most of its perlite production was thought to be consumed internally. Greece and Turkey remained the leading exporters of perlite. '","'Perlite occurrences in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon may contain large resources. Significant deposits have been reported in China, Greece, Turkey, and a few other countries. Available information was insufficient to make reliable estimates of resources in many perlite-producing countries.'","'In construction applications, diatomite, expanded clay and shale, pumice, and slag can be substituted for perlite. For horticultural uses, coco coir, pumice, vermiculite, and wood pulp are alternative soil additives and are sometimes used in conjunction with perlite.'"
