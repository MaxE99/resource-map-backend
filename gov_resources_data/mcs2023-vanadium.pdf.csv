MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'Vanadium production in Utah from the mining of uraniferous sandstones on the Colorado Plateau ceased in early 2020 and was not restarted in 2022. Secondary vanadium production continued in Arkansas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania where processed waste materials (petroleum residues, spent catalysts, utility ash) were used to produce ferrovanadium, vanadium-bearing chemicals or specialty alloys, and vanadium pentoxide. Metallurgical use, primarily as an alloying agent for iron and steel, accounted for about 94% of domestic reported vanadium consumption in 2022. Of the other uses for vanadium, the major nonmetallurgical use was in catalysts to produce maleic anhydride and sulfuric acid.'",'Recycling of vanadium is mainly associated with reprocessing vanadium catalysts into new catalysts. The range in vanadium content in spent catalysts varies depending on the crude oil feedstock and the uncertainty associated with the quantity of vanadium recycled from spent chemical process catalysts was significant.',"'Estimated U.S. apparent consumption of vanadium in 2022 increased by 11% from that in 2021. The estimated average Chinese vanadium pentoxide price in 2022 increased by 12% compared with the 2021 price, and the estimated United States ferrovanadium price increased by 55% to $24.00 per pound in 2022 compared with that in 2021. China continued to be the worlds top vanadium producer, producing the majority of its vanadium from vanadiferous iron ore processed for steel production. In the first half of 2022, a rise in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases led the Chinese Government to impose COVID-19 restrictions, causing a decrease in Chinas steel production. The vanadium market had anticipated vanadium disruptions owing to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. However, according to analysts, vanadium pentoxide trade flows between Russia and Czechia have been relatively unaffected by the conflict and Czechian ferrovanadium exports to customers in China, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States have also had limited disruptions. Uncertainty surrounding the supply of Russian material was expected to continue. Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) technology continued to be an increasingly important part of large-scale energy storage as it allows for high-safety, large-scale, environmentally friendly, medium- and long-term energy storage. Installations of VRFB projects increased worldwide as energy companies looked to support renewable energy projects as many countries attempt to lower their carbon emissions.'","'""World resources of vanadium exceed 63 million tons. Vanadium occurs in deposits of phosphate rock, titaniferous magnetite, and uraniferous sandstone and siltstone, in which it constitutes less than 2% of the host rock. Significant quantities are also present in bauxite and carboniferous materials, such as coal, crude oil, oil shale, and tar sands. Because vanadium is typically recovered as a byproduct or coproduct, demonstrated world resources of the element are not fully indicative of available supplies.'","'Steels containing various combinations of other alloying elements can be substituted for steels containing vanadium. Certain metals, such as manganese, molybdenum, niobium (columbium), titanium, and tungsten, are to some degree interchangeable with vanadium as alloying elements in steel. Platinum and nickel can replace vanadium compounds as catalysts in some chemical processes. Currently, no acceptable substitute for vanadium is available for use in aerospace titanium alloys.'"
