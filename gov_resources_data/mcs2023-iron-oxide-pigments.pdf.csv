MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'Iron oxide pigments (IOPs) were mined domestically by two companies in Alabama and Georgia. Mine production, which was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data, was slightly higher in 2022 compared with that in 2021. Five companies, including the two producers of natural IOPs, processed and sold about 29,000 tons of finished natural and synthetic IOPs with an estimated value of $29 million. About 50% of natural and synthetic finished |OPs were used in concrete and other construction materials; 15% each in industrial chemicals and in foundry sands and other foundry uses; 5% each in animal feed and in paint and coatings; 3% each in plastics and in glass and ceramics; and the remaining 4% in other uses.'",'None.',"'In the United States, residential construction, in which |OPs are commonly used to color concrete block and brick, ready-mixed concrete, and roofing tiles, increased slightly during the first 9 months of 2022 compared with that in the same period in 2021. IOPs are also used in paints and coatings for the aerospace, automotive, and marine industries. Vehicle production in the United States through August 2022 was 4.9% higher than that in 2021. |OPs characteristics of chemical and thermal stability, color strength, low cost, and weather resistance make IOPs a primary choice for colorant for coatings and construction materials. Imports of natural and synthetic pigments were estimated to have increased by 4% in 2022. Exports of pigment-grade IOPs were estimated to have increased by 21% in 2022 compared with those in 2021, mostly owing to an increase in exports to Chile, China, France, and the United Kingdom. Approximately 49% of pigment-grade IOPs exports went to Mexico; the other leading countries for exports were China (21%), Belgium (10%), and Chile (5%). IOPs are produced by several companies, but the three largest producers with facilities in multiple countries account for approximately 50% of the global IOP production capacity, with other companies in China accounting for a majority of the rest of the capacity. Some expansions of IOP production capacity in China were announced in early 2022. '",'Domestic and world resources for production of IOPs are adequate. Adequate resources are available worldwide for the manufacture of synthetic IOPs.',"'Milled |OPs are thought to be the most commonly used natural minerals for pigments. Because IOPs are color stable, low cost, and nontoxic, they can be economically used for imparting black, brown, red, and yellow coloring in large and relatively low-value applications. Other minerals may be used as colorants, but they generally cannot compete with IOPs because of their higher costs and more limited availability. Synthetic IOPs are widely used as colorants and compete with natural IOPs in many color applications. Organic colorants are used for some colorant applications, but many of the organic compounds fade over time from exposure to sunlight.'"
