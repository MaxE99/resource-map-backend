MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'Tin has not been mined or smelted in the United States since 1993 or 1989, respectively. Twenty-five firms accounted for over 95% of the primary tin consumed domestically in 2022. The major uses for tin in the United States were chemicals, 23%; tinplate, 22%; alloys, 11%; solder, 10%; babbitt, brass and bronze, and tinning, 7%; bar tin, 2%; and other, 25%. Based on the average S&P Global Platts Metals Week New York dealer price for tin, the estimated value of imported refined tin in 2022 was $1.3 billion, and the estimated value of tin recovered from old scrap domestically in 2022 was $330 million.'","'About 18,000 tons of tin from old and new scrap was estimated to have been recycled in 2022. Of this, about 10,000 tons was recovered from old scrap at 1 detinning plant and about 22 secondary nonferrous-metal- processing plants, accounting for 22% of apparent consumption.'","'The estimated amount of tin recycled domestically in 2022 increased by 8% compared with that in 2021. The estimated annual average New York dealer price for refined tin in 2022 was 1,600 cents per pound, a slight increase compared with that in 2021. The estimated annual average LME cash price for refined tin in 2022 was 1,500 cents per pound, unchanged from that in 2021. In 2022, the monthly average New York dealer tin price decreased from March to October. In May, a copper products manufacturer based in Germany purchased a United States metals recycling company capable of processing scrap, including tin, at the rate of 100,000 tons per year. Also in May, a company announced plans to build a $340 million electronic-waste and nonferrous-metals recycling plant in Fort Wayne, IN. The facility will have the capacity to recycle up to 45,000 tons per year of feedstock; construction was expected to begin in 2023 and conclude by 2025. In June, construction began on a secondary smelter for complex recyclable materials in Richmond County, GA. The facility will have the capacity to process up to 90,000 tons per year of recyclables and will recover multiple metals, including tin. The facility, which would cost approximately $320 million to construct, was expected to begin operations in the first half of 2024. Throughout the year, smelters were temporarily closed in China owing to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related mitigation measures and annual maintenance. Intermittent truck driver strikes in Spain caused disruptions and halted shipments of tin and tungsten concentrates. In 2022, mining began from a new pit at the Penouta Mine in northwestern Spain, a deposit containing a measured and indicated resource of 76.3 million tons at 443 parts per million tin. In March, the indicated and inferred resources at the Mpama South deposit in Congo (Kinshasa) were updated to 105,000 tons of contained tin. Additionally, the company mining the deposit announced an expansion to begin in late 2023 that would increase its tin production to approximately 20,000 tons per year. '","'Identified resources of tin in the United States, primarily in Alaska, were insignificant compared with those of the rest of the world. World resources, principally in western Africa, southeastern Asia, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, and Russia, are extensive and, if developed, could sustain recent annual production rates well into the future.'","'Aluminum, glass, paper, plastic, or tin-free steel substitute for tin in cans and containers. Other materials that substitute for tin are epoxy resins for solder; aluminum alloys, alternative copper-base alloys, and plastics for bronze; plastics for bearing metals that contain tin; and compounds of lead and sodium for some tin chemicals.'"
