1000 MT,,2018,2019,2019,"'The value of zinc mined in 2019, based on zinc contained in concentrate, was about $2.1 billion. Zinc was mined in six States at 15 mines operated by five companies. Two smelter facilities, one primary and one secondary, operated by two companies, produced commercial-grade zinc metal. Of the total reported zinc consumed, most was used in galvanizing, followed by brass and bronze, zinc-based alloys, and other uses.'","'In 2019, about 25% (30,000 tons) of the refined zinc produced in the United States was recovered from secondary materials at both primary and secondary smelters. Secondary materials included galvanizing residues and crude zinc oxide recovered from electric arc furnace dust.'","'Global zinc mine production in 2019 was estimated to be 13 million tons, a 4% increase from that of 2018. Notable zinc mine production increases took place in Australia, China, and South Africa. In Australia, the Woodlawn tailings project opened in May and significant increases in production took place at the Dugald River Mine, the Lady Loretta Mine, and two tailings reprocessing projects commissioned in 2018. In South Africa, production increased at the Gamsberg Mine, which was commissioned in late 2018. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group,8 global refined zinc production in 2019 was estimated to be 13.49 million tons, and metal consumption was estimated to be 13.67 million tons, resulting in a production-to- consumption deficit of about 180,000 tons of refined zinc. Domestic zinc mine production decreased in 2019, owing partially to the closure of the Pend Oreille Mine in Washington State in July after current reserves were exhausted. The mine was reopened in December 2014 after being closed since 2009. U.S. apparent consumption of refined zinc increased to a 5-year high of 950,000 tons in 2019. The estimated annual average North American Special High Grade (SHG) zinc price decreased by 11% in 2019 from that in 2018 to $1.25 per pound.'",'Identified zinc resources of the world are about 1.9 billion tons.',"'Aluminum and plastics substitute for galvanized sheet in automobiles; aluminum alloys, cadmium, paint, and plastic coatings replace zinc coatings in other applications. Aluminum- and magnesium-base alloys are major competitors for zinc-base diecasting alloys. Many elements are substitutes for zinc in chemical, electronic, and pigment uses.'"
