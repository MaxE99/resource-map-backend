MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'In 2022, U.S. mines produced approximately 1,100 tons of silver with an estimated value of $720 million. Silver was produced at 4 silver mines and as a byproduct or coproduct from 31 domestic base- and precious-metal operations. Alaska continued as the countrys leading silver-producing State, followed by Nevada. There were 24 U.S. refiners that reported production of commercial-grade silver with an estimated total output of 2,700 tons from domestic and foreign ores and concentrates and from new and old scrap. The physical properties of silver include high ductility, electrical conductivity, malleability, and reflectivity. In 2022, the estimated domestic uses for silver were physical investment (bars), 34%; electrical and electronics, 27%; coins and medals, 13%; photovoltaics (PV), 10%; jewelry and silverware, 6%; brazing and solder, 3%; and other industrial uses and photography, 7%. Other applications for silver include use in antimicrobial bandages, clothing, pharmaceuticals, and plastics; batteries; bearings; brazing and soldering; catalytic converters in automobiles; electroplating; inks; mirrors; photography; photovoltaic solar cells; water purification; and wood treatment. Mercury and silver, the main components of dental amalgam, are biocides, and their use in amalgam inhibits recurrent decay.'","'In 2022, approximately 900 tons of silver was recovered from new and old scrap, accounting for about 14% of apparent consumption.'","'The estimated average silver price in 2022 was $21 per troy ounce, 17% lower than the average price in 2021. The price began the year at $22.80 per troy ounce, increased to a high of $26.45 per troy ounce on March 8, then decreased to a low of $17.85 per troy ounce on September 1. The price of silver began to increase in September into December.  In 2022, global consumption of silver was estimated to have reached 38,000 tons, a new record and a 16% increase from that in 2021. Coin and bar consumption increased by 18% in 2022, increasing for the sixth year in a row. Physical investment in India nearly doubled compared with that in 2021. In 2022, consumption of silver for industrial uses was estimated to have increased by 5% compared with that in 2021 owing to the installation of fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure, increased production of PV, increased production of light duty vehicles (LDVs), and more silver used in newer LDVs. Consumption of silver in jewelry and silverware was estimated to have increased by 29% and 72%, respectively.8 World silver mine production increased by 4% in 2022 to an estimated 26,000 tons, principally as a result of increased production from mines in Chile and other countries as silver mines were still recovering from shutdowns in 2020 in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Domestic silver mine production was estimated to have increased by 8% in 2022 to 1,100 tons compared with 1,020 tons produced in 2021. '","'Although silver was a principal product at several mines, silver was primarily obtained as a byproduct from lead-zinc, copper, and gold mines, in descending order of silver production. The polymetallic ore deposits from which silver was recovered account for more than two-thirds of U.S. and world resources of silver. Most recent silver discoveries have been associated with gold occurrences; however, copper and lead-zinc occurrences that contain byproduct silver will continue to account for a significant share of reserves and resources in the future.'","'Digital imaging, film with reduced silver content, silverless black-and-white film, and xerography substitute for traditional photographic applications for silver. Surgical pins and plates may be made with stainless steel, tantalum, and titanium in place of silver. Stainless steel may be substituted for silver flatware. Nonsilver batteries may replace silver batteries in some applications. Aluminum and rhodium may be used to replace silver that was traditionally used in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces. Silver may be used to replace more costly metals in catalytic converters for off-road vehicles.'"
