1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,"'In 2021, one company recovered zircon (zirconium silicate) from surface-mining operations in Florida and Georgia as a coproduct from the mining of heavy-mineral sands and the processing of titanium and zirconium mineral concentrates, and a second company processed existing mineral sands tailings in Florida. Zirconium metal and hafnium metal were produced from zirconium chemical intermediates by one producer in Oregon and one in Utah. Zirconium and hafnium are typically contained in zircon at a ratio of about 36 to 1. Zirconium chemicals were produced by the metal producer in Oregon and by at least 10 other companies. Ceramics, foundry sand, opacifiers, and refractories are the leading end uses for zircon. Other end uses of zircon include abrasives, chemicals (predominantly, zirconium basic sulfate and zirconium oxychloride octohydrate as intermediate chemicals), metal alloys, and welding rod coatings. The leading consumers of zirconium metal are the chemical process and nuclear energy industries. The leading use of hafnium metal is in superalloys.'",'Companies in Oregon and Utah recycled zirconium from new scrap generated during metal production and fabrication and (or) from post-commercial old scrap. Zircon foundry mold cores and spent or rejected zirconia refractories are often recycled. Hafnium metal recycling was insignificant.',"'Global production of zirconium mineral concentrates was essentially unchanged in 2021 compared with that in 2020. Advanced exploration and development projects with planned production of zircon concentrates were ongoing in Australia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania, and elsewhere. In the United States, mining and heavy-mineral-processing operations were expanded near Starke, FL, and prefeasibility studies were underway at the Titan heavy-mineral-sands project near Camden, TN. U.S. exports of zirconium ores and concentrates were essentially unchanged, whereas imports increased by 15% from those in 2020 but remained lower than those in previous years. Australia, Senegal, and South Africa continued to be the leading import sources of zirconium ores and concentrates. The leading global exporters of zirconium mineral concentrates were Australia, Senegal, and South Africa. The leading global importers were China, India, and Spain. Global producers of zirconium sponge included China, France, India, Russia, and the United States. The leading global exporters of unwrought zirconium metal under Harmonized System Code 8109.20 were China, Germany, and the United States. France and Russia led the global importers of unwrought zirconium.'","""' Resources of zircon in the United States included about 14 million tons associated with titanium resources in heavy-mineral-sand deposits. Phosphate rock and sand and gravel deposits could potentially yield substantial amounts of zircon as a byproduct. World resources of hafnium are associated with those of zircon and baddeleyite. Quantitative estimates of hafnium resources were not available.""","'Chromite and olivine can be used instead of zircon for some foundry applications. Dolomite and spinel refractories can also substitute for zircon in certain high-temperature applications. Niobium (columbium), stainless steel, and tantalum provide limited substitution in nuclear applications, and titanium and synthetic materials may substitute in some chemical processing plant applications. Silver-cadmium-indium control rods are used in lieu of hafnium at numerous nuclear powerplants. Zirconium can be used interchangeably with hafnium in certain superalloys.'"
