MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'No domestic production of commercial tungsten concentrates has been reported since 2015. Approximately six U.S. companies had the capability to convert tungsten concentrates, ammonium paratungstate (APT), tungsten oxide, and (or) scrap to tungsten metal powder, tungsten carbide powder, and (or) tungsten chemicals. An estimated 60% of the tungsten consumed in the United States was used in cemented carbide parts for cutting and wear-resistant applications, primarily in the construction, metalworking, mining, and oil- and gas- drilling industries. The remainder was used to make various alloys and specialty steels; electrodes, filaments, wires, and other components for electrical, electronic, heating, lighting, and welding applications; and chemicals for various applications. The estimated value of apparent consumption in 2022 was approximately $800 million.'",'The estimated quantity of secondary tungsten produced and the amount consumed from secondary sources by processors and end users in 2022 were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data.',"'World tungsten supply was dominated by production in China and exports from China. Chinas Government regulated its tungsten industry by prohibiting foreign investment in exploration and mining, limiting the number of mining and export licenses and imposing quotas on concentrate production and processing. Production of tungsten concentrate outside China was estimated to have increased in 2022 but remained less than 20% of world production. The increase was from existing operations. Additional production, primarily from reopened mines in Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom, was forecast to begin in 2023. Scrap continued to be an important source of raw material for the world tungsten industry. Tungsten consumption is strongly influenced by economic conditions and industrial activity. China continued to be the worlds leading tungsten consumer. In 2022, Chinas tungsten consumption by vehicle and other manufacturing industries was negatively affected by lockdowns to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreaks. In the United States, increased oil and gas drilling and a recovery of the aerospace industry resulted in an estimated increase in tungsten consumption. Potential areas of future growth in tungsten consumption include new applications such as powders for additive manufacturing and the use of tungsten in lithium-ion batteries.'",'World tungsten resources are geographically widespread. China ranks first in the world in terms of tungsten resources and reserves and has some of the largest deposits. Significant tungsten resources have been identified on every continent except Antarctica.',"'Potential substitutes for cemented tungsten carbides include cemented carbides based on molybdenum carbide, niobium carbide, or titanium carbide; ceramics; ceramic-metallic composites (cermets); and tool steels. Most of these options reduce, rather than replace, the amount of tungsten used. Potential substitutes for other applications are as follows: molybdenum for certain tungsten mill products; molybdenum steels for tungsten steels, although most molybdenum steels still contain tungsten; lighting based on carbon nanotube filaments, induction technology, and light-emitting diodes for lighting based on tungsten electrodes or filaments; depleted uranium or lead for tungsten or tungsten alloys in applications requiring high density or the ability to shield radiation; and depleted uranium alloys or hardened steel for cemented tungsten carbides or tungsten alloys in armor-piercing projectiles. In some applications, substitution would result in increased cost or a loss in product performance.'"
