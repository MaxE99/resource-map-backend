Kct,,2018,2019,"'The combined value of U.S. natural and synthetic gemstone output in 2019 was an estimated $65 million, a 9% increase compared with that of 2018. Domestic gemstone production included agate, beryl, coral, diamond, garnet, jade, jasper, opal, pearl, quartz, sapphire, shell, topaz, tourmaline, turquoise, and many other gem materials. In decreasing order of production value, Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, California, Montana, Maine, Arkansas, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, North Carolina, Tennessee, and New York produced 96% of U.S. natural gemstones. Synthetic gemstones were manufactured by four firms in North Carolina, California, Maryland, and Arizona, in decreasing order of production value. Major gemstone uses were carvings, gem and mineral collections, and jewelry.'","'Gemstones are often recycled by being resold as estate jewelry, reset, or recut, but this report does not account for those stones.'","'In 2019, U.S. imports for consumption of gem-quality diamonds were estimated to be about $23 billion, which was an 8% decrease compared with $25.1 billion in 2018. U.S. imports for consumption of natural, nondiamond gemstones were estimated to be about $3.0 billion, which was a 14% increase compared with $2.64 billion in 2018. U.S. synthetic gemstone production increased by 10% compared with that in 2018. The increase in synthetic production was because of the combination of a 5% increase in the value of U.S. synthetic diamond production and a 16% increase in the value of U.S. synthetic moissanite production compared with those of 2018. No synthetic diamond production was reported in South Carolina during 2019. The United States accounted for more than 35% of the worlds diamond consumption and was once again the leading global market in terms of consumer demand. The United States is expected to continue to dominate global gemstone demand. Consumption also increased in Asia. During the first three quarters of 2019, globally, the leading gemstone sales by value were diamond, emerald, ruby, sapphire, and tanzanite. Worldwide rough gem-grade diamond sales decreased by 39% during the first three quarters compared with the same period of 2018. Total world diamond production during 2019 increased slightly from 2018 levels. Production is expected to continue to remain steady in the near term and then decline slightly, until 2025, when several large mines are expected to reach the end of their mine life, and only a few new projects are being developed.'","'Most diamond-bearing ore bodies have a diamond content that ranges from less than 1 carat per ton to about 6 carats per ton of ore. The major diamond reserves are in southern Africa, Australia, Canada, and Russia.'","'Glass, plastics, and other materials are substituted for natural gemstones. Synthetic gemstones (manufactured materials that have the same chemical and physical properties as natural gemstones) are common substitutes. Simulants (materials that appear to be gems but differ in chemical and physical characteristics) also are frequently substituted for natural gemstones.'"
