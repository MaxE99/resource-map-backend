1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'The estimated value of zinc mined in 2022 was about $3.2 billion. Zinc was mined in five States at seven mining operations by five companies. Three smelter facilities, one primary and two secondary, operated by three companies, produced commercial-grade zinc metal. Of the total reported zinc consumed, most was used to produce galvanized steel, followed by brass and bronze, zinc-base alloys, and other uses.'","'In 2022, an estimated 60% of the refined zinc produced in the United States was recovered from secondary materials at both primary and secondary smelters. Secondary materials included galvanizing residues and crude zinc oxide recovered from electric arc furnace dust.'","'On February 24, 2022, a final U.S. critical minerals list was published in the Federal Register (87 FR 10381). The 2022 critical minerals list was an update of the list of critical minerals published in 2018 in the Federal Register (83 FR 23295). The 2022 critical minerals list contained 50 individual mineral commodities instead of 35 minerals and mineral groups. The changes in the 2022 list from the prior list were the addition of nickel and zinc and the removal of helium, potash, rhenium, strontium, and uranium. The list is to be updated every 3 years and revised as necessary consistent with available data. U.S. zinc mine production increased by 9% in 2022 compared with that in 2021. Zinc production at the Red Dog zinc-lead mine in Alaska, the largest zinc mine in the United States, increased notably compared with that in 2021 owing to higher mill throughput and zinc ore grades. The owner of the Empire State zinc mine in New York received permitting to begin open pit mining activities. An open pit mine would operate alongside the active underground mine and was expected to contribute to an increase in mill throughput in the first half of 2023. Several other zinc exploration and mine expansion projects were in active development in the United States during 2022. The North American price for Special High Grade (SHG) zinc was estimated to have increased by 30% in 2022 from that in 2021. The North American premium to the LME cash price reached historical highs in 2022 amid decreasing stocks on the London Metal Exchange, reduced production by zinc smelters in Europe because of high energy costs, and the permanent closure of a zinc smelter in Canada. Other zinc smelters in Canada and Mexico reported equipment and operational issues that negatively affected production during the year. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group,9 estimated global refined zinc production in 2022 was forecast to decrease by 2.7% to 13.49 million tons and estimated metal consumption to decrease by 1.9% to 13.79 million tons, resulting in a production-to-consumption deficit of 297,000 tons. '","'"" Identified zinc resources of the world are about 1.9 billion tons.'","'Aluminum and plastics substitute for galvanized sheet in automobiles; aluminum alloys, cadmium, paint, and plastic coatings replace zinc coatings in other applications. Aluminum- and magnesium-base alloys are major substitutes for zinc-base diecasting alloys. Many elements are substitutes for zinc in chemical, electronic, and pigment uses.'"
