MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'In 2020, primary selenium was refined from anode slimes recovered from the electrolytic refining of copper at one facility in Texas. Two other electrolytic copper refineries, operating in Arizona and Utah, did not recover selenium domestically, but did produce selenium-bearing anode slimes. U.S. selenium production and consumption data were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Estimates for end uses in global consumption were, in descending order, metallurgy (including manganese production), glass manufacturing, agriculture, chemicals and pigments, electronics, and other uses. Selenium is used in blasting caps to control delays; in catalysts to enhance selective oxidation; in copper, lead, and steel alloys to improve machinability; in the electrolytic production of manganese to increase yields; in glass manufacturing to decolorize the green tint caused by iron impurities in container glass and other soda-lime silica glass; in gun bluing to improve cosmetic appearance and provide corrosion resistance; in plating solutions to improve appearance and durability; in rubber compounding chemicals to act as a vulcanizing agent; and in thin-film photovoltaic copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) solar cells. Selenium is an essential micronutrient and is used as a human dietary supplement, a dietary supplement for livestock, and as a fertilizer additive to enrich selenium-poor soils. Selenium is also used as an active ingredient in antidandruff shampoos. '",'Domestic production of secondary selenium was estimated to be very small because most scrap from older plain paper photocopiers and electronic materials was exported for recovery of the contained selenium.',"'The supply of selenium is directly affected by the supply of the materials from which it is a byproductcopper and, to a lesser extent, nickeland it is directly affected by the number of facilities that recover selenium. The estimated annual average price for selenium was $20.00 per pound in 2020, unchanged from that in 2019. Average monthly prices have remained steady since November 2018. Electrolytic manganese production was the main metallurgical end use for selenium in China, where selenium dioxide was used in the electrolytic process to increase current efficiency and the metal deposition rate. Selenium consumption in China was thought to have increased in recent years, owing to higher manganese metal production. In January, Chinese production of selenium dioxide was temporarily halted owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, but production resumed in late February. Later in the year, Chinese importers of selenium had decreased their intakes owing to adequate stocks from previous purchases, reduced demand from the manganese, glassmaking, and ceramics sectors, and sufficient feedstock from domestic copper producers who sold crude selenium to selenium powder and selenium dioxide producers.'","'Reserves for selenium are based on identified copper deposits and average selenium content. Coal generally contains between 0.5 and 12 parts per million selenium, or about 80 to 90 times the average for copper deposits. The recovery of selenium from coal fly ash, although technically feasible, does not appear likely to be economical in the foreseeable future.'","'Silicon is the major substitute for selenium in low- and medium-voltage rectifiers. Organic pigments have been developed as substitutes for cadmium sulfoselenide pigments. Other substitutes include cerium oxide as either a colorant or decolorant in glass; tellurium in pigments and rubber; bismuth, lead, and tellurium in free- machining alloys; and bismuth and tellurium in lead-free brasses. Sulfur dioxide can be used as a replacement for selenium dioxide in the production of electrolytic manganese metal, but it is not as energy efficient. The selenium-tellurium photoreceptors used in some plain paper copiers and laser printers have been replaced by organic photoreceptors in newer machines. Amorphous silicon and cadmium telluride are the two principal competitors with CIGS in thin-film photovoltaic solar cells. '"
