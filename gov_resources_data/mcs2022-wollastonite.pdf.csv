MT,,2020,2021,"Wollastonite was mined by two companies in New York during 2021. U.S. production of wollastonite (sold or used by producers) was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data but was estimated to have increased from that of 2020. Economic resources of wollastonite typically form as a result of thermal metamorphism of siliceous limestone during regional deformation or chemical alteration of limestone by siliceous hydrothermal fluids along faults or contacts with magmatic intrusions. Deposits of wollastonite have been identified in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Utah; however, New York is the only State where long-term continuous mining has taken place. The U.S. Geological Survey does not collect consumption statistics for wollastonite, but consumption was estimated to have increased in 2021 compared with that of 2020. Ceramics (frits, sanitaryware, and tile), friction products (primarily brake linings), metallurgical applications (flux and conditioner), paint (architectural and industrial paints), plastics and rubber markets (thermoplastic and thermoset resins and elastomer compounds), and miscellaneous uses (including adhesives, concrete, glass, and sealants) accounted for wollastonite sales in the United States. In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing; increases green and fired strength; maintains brightness during firing; permits fast firing; and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and protects the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel. As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves resistance to weathering, reduces gloss and pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and suspending agent. In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength.",None.,"Construction starts of new housing units through July 2021 increased by 21.8% compared with those during the same period in 2020 with the largest increase in starts being in single unit, privately owned houses. Sales of wollastonite to domestic construction-related markets, such as adhesives, caulks, cement board, ceramic tile, paints, stucco, and wallboard, were thought to have increased as well as sales of wollastonite for primary iron and steel production, which increased by 18% compared with those during the same period of 2020. Supply-chain issues as well as the continuing impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic limited consumption in two major markets. The production of motor vehicles and parts, which contain wollastonite in friction products and plastic and rubber components, decreased slightly in the first 7 months of 2021 and was 35% lower than production in 2019. Plastics production was expected to be 3% lower in 2021 than that in 2020. Globally, ceramics, paint, and polymers (such as plastics and rubber) accounted for most wollastonite sales. Lesser global uses for wollastonite included miscellaneous construction products, friction materials, metallurgical applications, and paper. Several research projects continued in Canada, India, and the United States to evaluate the efficacy of wollastonite in carbon dioxide sequestration. Studies were being conducted to evaluate wollastonites ability to capture atmospheric carbon dioxide when added to crop fields and its ability to enhance crop productivity. Wollastonites ability to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in cement production by lowering kiln temperatures needed to produce cement and absorbing carbon dioxide in the process was being evaluated. Global sales of wollastonite were estimated to be in the range of 850,000 to 950,000 tons, higher than those in 2020.","Reliable estimates of wollastonite resources do not exist for most countries. Large deposits of wollastonite have been identified in China, Finland, India, Mexico, and the United States. Smaller, but significant, deposits have been identified in Canada, Chile, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.","The acicular nature of many wollastonite products allows wollastonite to compete with other acicular materials, such as ceramic fiber, glass fiber, steel fiber, and several organic fibers, such as aramid, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene, in products where improvements in dimensional stability, flexural modulus, and heat deflection are sought. Wollastonite also competes with several nonfibrous minerals or rocks, such as kaolin, mica, and talc, which are added to plastics to increase flexural strength, and such minerals as barite, calcium carbonate, gypsum, and talc, which impart dimensional stability to plastics. In ceramics, wollastonite competes with carbonates, feldspar, lime, and silica as a source of calcium and silica. Its use in ceramics depends on the formulation of the ceramic body and the firing method."
