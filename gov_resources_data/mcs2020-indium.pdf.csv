MT,,2018,2019,"Indium was not recovered from ores in the United States in 2019. Several companies produced indium productsincluding alloys, compounds, high-purity metal, and soldersfrom imported indium metal. Production of indium tin oxide (ITO) continued to account for most of global indium consumption. ITO thin-film coatings were primarily used for electrical conductive purposes in a variety of flat-panel displaysmost commonly liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Other indium end uses included alloys and solders, compounds, electrical components and semiconductors, and research. Based on an average of recent annual import levels, estimated domestic consumption of refined indium was 110 tons in 2019. The estimated value of refined indium consumed domestically in 2019, based on the average New York dealer price, was about $43 million.","Indium is most commonly recovered from ITO scrap in Japan and the Republic of Korea. A significant quantity of scrap was recycled domestically; however, data on the quantity of secondary indium recovered from scrap were not available.","The 2019 estimated average New York dealer price of indium was $390 per kilogram, 4% more than that of 2018. The average monthly price in January was $390 per kilogram where it remained through September. The 2019 estimated average free market price of indium was $210 per kilogram, 28% less than in 2018. The average monthly free market price began the year at $232 per kilogram and decreased throughout the year to an average of $160 per kilogram in September.In January, the Fanya Metal Exchange attempted to auction two lots of indium, totaling 37.41 tons, with a starting price of $170 per kilogram, but no bids were received. A second auction for 34.64 tons of indium was held in April, and the total lot sold for about $5.5 million ($161 per kilogram) to the State-owned China National Corporation for Overseas Economic Cooperation (CCOEC). The Fanya Metal Exchange reportedly held 3,600 tons of indium, which is equivalent to 4 years of global primary indium production, before it closed in 2015. New telecommunication networks have created a new demand for indium, which is used for indium phosphide (InP) lasers and receivers. InP lasers are used in telecommunications for fiber-optic networks that have connections between third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation (3G, 4G, and 5G) wireless antennas; have data transmission speeds of greater than 10 terabits per second; and have total transmission distances of more than 5,000 kilometers.",Indium is most commonly recovered from the zinc-sulfide ore mineral sphalerite. The indium content of zinc deposits from which it is recovered ranges from less than 1 part per million to 100 parts per million. Although the geochemical properties of indium are such that it occurs in trace amounts in other base-metal sulfides particularly chalcopyrite and stannitemost deposits of these minerals are subeconomic for indium.,"Antimony tin oxide coatings have been developed as an alternative to ITO coatings in LCDs and have been successfully annealed to LCD glass; carbon nanotube coatings have been developed as an alternative to ITO coatings in flexible displays, solar cells, and touch screens; PEDOT [poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)] has also been developed as a substitute for ITO in flexible displays and organic light-emitting diodes; and copper or silver nanowires have been explored as a substitute for ITO in touch screens. Graphene has been developed to replace ITO electrodes in solar cells and also has been explored as a replacement for ITO in flexible touch screens. Researchers have developed a more adhesive zinc oxide nanopowder to replace ITO in LCDs. Hafnium can replace indium in nuclear reactor control rod alloys."
