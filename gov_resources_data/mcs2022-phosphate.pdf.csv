1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'In 2021, phosphate rock ore was mined by five companies at 10 mines in four States and processed into an estimated 22 million tons of marketable product, valued at $1.7 billion, free on board (f.o.b.) mine. Florida and North Carolina accounted for more than 75% of total domestic output; the remainder was produced in Idaho and Utah. Marketable product refers to beneficiated phosphate rock with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) content suitable for phosphoric acid or elemental phosphorus production. More than 95% of the phosphate rock mined in the United States was used to manufacture wet-process phosphoric acid and superphosphoric acid, which were used as intermediate feedstocks in the manufacture of granular and liquid ammonium phosphate fertilizers and animal feed supplements. About 25% of the wet-process phosphoric acid produced was exported in the form of upgraded granular diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer and merchant-grade phosphoric acid. The balance of the phosphate rock mined was for the manufacture of elemental phosphorus, which was used to produce phosphorus compounds for industrial applications, primarily glyphosate herbicide.'",'None.',"'In 2021, domestic consumption of phosphate rock was estimated to be about the same as that in 2020. DAP and MAP production decreased as a result, in part, of technical problems at a phosphate plant in Florida and owing to the effects of Hurricane Ida in August, which damaged phosphate facilities in Louisiana. The affected facilities reopened in the fourth quarter. World production was estimated to be about the same as that in 2020, with China, Morocco, and the United States remaining the leading producers. Production in Jordan, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia increased as expansions to capacity were being ramped up in 2021. Capacity expansion projects were ongoing in Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa; however, none of the projects were expected to be completed until after 2024. One producer in Idaho submitted plans to shift production to a new phosphate rock mine when its existing mine is exhausted in about 5 years. The new mine would be located close to the current mine in Caribou County, and annual production capacity was expected to remain the same. World consumption of P2O5 contained in fertilizer products was estimated to have increased by 7% in crop-year 2021 (July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021) compared with that in crop-year 2020. The increases in world consumption and trade were driven by high crop prices, increased planted crop area, and increased crop exports. This was a continuation of the trend that began late in 2020, as markets rebounded from poor weather conditions in the growing season. South America and Asia were leading regions of growth in consumption of phosphate fertilizer, in terms of percentage increase over that in 2020.'","'* Some world reserves were reported only in terms of ore tonnage and grade. Phosphate rock resources occur principally as sedimentary marine phosphorites. The largest sedimentary deposits are found in northern Africa, the Middle East, China, and the United States. Significant igneous occurrences are found in Brazil, Canada, Finland, Russia, and South Africa. Large phosphate resources have been identified on the continental shelves and on seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. World resources of phosphate rock are more than 300 billion tons. There are no imminent shortages of phosphate rock.'",'There are no substitutes for phosphorus in agriculture.'
