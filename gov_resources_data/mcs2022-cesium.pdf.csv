MT,"In 2021, no cesium was mined domestically, and the United States was 100% net import reliant for cesium minerals. Pollucite, mainly found in association with lithium-rich, lepidolite-bearing or petalite- bearing zoned granite pegmatites, is the principal cesium ore mineral. Cesium minerals are used as feedstocks to produce a variety of cesium compounds and cesium metal. The primary application for cesium, by gross weight, is in cesium formate brines used for high-pressure, high-temperature well drilling for oil and gas exploration and production. With the exception of cesium formate, cesium is used in relatively small-scale applications, using only a few grams for most applications. Owing to the lack of global availability of cesium, many applications have used mineral substitutes and the use of cesium in any particular application may no longer be viable. Cesium metal is used in the production of cesium compounds and potentially in photoelectric cells. Cesium bromide is used in infrared detectors, optics, photoelectric cells, scintillation counters, and spectrophotometers. Cesium carbonate is used in the alkylation of organic compounds and in energy conversion devices, such as fuel cells, magneto-hydrodynamic generators, and polymer solar cells. Cesium chloride is used in analytical chemistry applications as a reagent, in high-temperature solders, as an intermediate in cesium metal production, in isopycnic centrifugation, as a radioisotope in nuclear medicine, as an insect repellent in agricultural applications, and in specialty glasses. Cesium hydroxide is used as an electrolyte in alkaline storage batteries. Cesium iodide is used in fluoroscopy equipmentFourier-transform infrared spectrometersas the input phosphor of X-ray image intensifier tubes, and in scintillators. Cesium nitrate is used as a colorant and oxidizer in the pyrotechnic industry, in petroleum cracking, in scintillation counters, and in X-ray phosphors. Cesium sulfates are soluble in water and are thought to be used primarily in water treatment, fuel cells, and to improve optical quality for scientific instruments. Cesium isotopes, which are obtained as a byproduct in nuclear fission or formed from other isotopes, such as barium-131, are used in electronic, medical, metallurgical, and research applications. Cesium isotopes are used as an atomic resonance frequency standard in atomic clocks, playing a vital role in aircraft guidance systems, global positioning satellites, and internet and cellular telephone transmissions. Cesium clocks monitor the cycles of microwave radiation emitted by cesiums electrons and use these cycles as a time reference. Owing to the high accuracy of the cesium atomic clock, the international definition of 1 second is based on the cesium atom. The U.S. civilian time and frequency standard is based on a cesium fountain clock at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, CO. The U.S. military frequency standard, the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) timescale, is based on 48 weighted atomic clocks, including 25 USNO cesium fountain clocks. A company in Richland, WA, produced a range of cesium-131 medical products for treatment of various cancers. Cesium-137 may be used in industrial gauges, in mining and geophysical instruments, and for sterilization of food, sewage, and surgical equipment. Because of the danger posed by the radiological properties of cesium-137, efforts to find substitutes in its applications continued.","Cesium formate brines are typically rented by oil and gas exploration clients. After completion of the well, the used cesium formate brine is returned and reprocessed for subsequent drilling operations. Cesium formate brines are recycled, recovering nearly 85% of the brines for recycling to be reprocessed for further use.","Domestic cesium occurrences will likely remain uneconomic unless market conditions change. No known human health issues are associated with naturally occurring cesium, and its use has minimal environmental impact. Manufactured radioactive isotopes of cesium have been known to cause adverse health effects. Certain cesium compounds may be toxic if consumed. Food that has been irradiated using the radioisotope cesium-137 has been found to be safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. During 2021, no primary cesium mine production was reported globally but cesium was thought to have been mined in China. Mine production of cesium from all countries, excluding China, ceased within the past two decades. Production in Namibia ceased in the early 2000s, followed by the Tanco Mine in Canada shutting down and later being sold after a mine collapse in 2015. The Bikita Mine in Zimbabwe was depleted of pollucite ore reserves in 2018, and the Sinclair Mine in Australia completed the mining and shipments of all economically recoverable pollucite ore in 2019. Recent reports indicate that with current processing rates for the only operating intermediate refinery in Germany, the worlds stockpiles of cesium ore, excluding those in China, will be depleted within a few years. A company completed an updated mineral resource estimate for the Karibib project in Namibia, reporting 8.9 million metric tons of measured and indicated resources containing 0.23% rubidium and 303 parts per million cesium. The company also reported 6.72 million metric tons of proven and probable reserves containing 2.26% rubidium and 320 parts per million cesium. Located in the Karibib Pegmatite Belt, lithium would be the primary product, with cesium, potassium, and rubidium as potential byproducts. Development of the Karibib project continued in 2021.","Cesium is associated with lithium-bearing pegmatites worldwide, and cesium resources have been identified in Australia, Canada, Namibia, the United States, and Zimbabwe. In the United States, pollucite occurs in pegmatites in Alaska, Maine, and South Dakota. Lower concentrations occur in brines in Chile and China and in geothermal systems in Germany, India, and China. China was thought to have cesium-rich deposits of geyserite, lepidolite, and pollucite, with concentrations highest in Yichun, Jiangxi Province, although no resource, reserve, or production estimates were available.","Cesium and rubidium can be used interchangeably in many applications because they have similar physical properties and atomic radii. Cesium, however, is more electropositive than rubidium, making it a preferred material for some applications. However, rubidium is mined from similar deposits, in relatively smaller quantities, as a byproduct of cesium production in pegmatites and as a byproduct of lithium production from lepidolite (hard-rock) mining and processing, making it no more readily available than cesium."
