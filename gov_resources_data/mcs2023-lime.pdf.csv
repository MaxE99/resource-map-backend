1000 MT,,2021,2022,"'In 2022, an estimated 17 million tons of quicklime and hydrated lime was produced (excluding independent commercial hydrators2), valued at about $2.3 billion. Lime was produced by 28 companies 18 with commercial sales and 10 that produced lime strictly for internal use (for example, sugar companies). These companies had 73 primary lime plants (plants operating quicklime kilns) in 28 States and Puerto Rico. One primary lime plant was idle in 2022. Of the 28 companies, 5 operated only hydrating plants in nine States. In 2022, the five leading U.S. lime companies produced quicklime or hydrated in 22 States and accounted for about 79% of U.S. lime production. Principal producing States were Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Texas. Major markets for lime were, in descending order of consumption, steelmaking, chemical and industrial applications (such as the manufacture of fertilizer, glass, paper and pulp, and precipitated calcium carbonate, and in sugar refining), flue gas treatment, construction, water treatment, and nonferrous-metal mining.'",'Large quantities of lime are regenerated by paper mills. Some municipal water-treatment plants regenerate lime from softening sludge. Quicklime is regenerated from waste hydrated lime in the carbide industry. Data for these sources were not included as production in order to avoid double counting.',"'In 2022, domestic lime production was estimated to be essentially unchanged from that in 2021. In 2020, a decline in lime production was a result of plants temporarily closing owing to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the economy continues to rebound from the effects of the pandemic, so does the lime industry. However, some of the lime producers have increased product pricing owing to increased costs of production. In 2022, a total of 73 quicklime plants were in operation along with 10 hydrating plants. Hydrated lime is a dry calcium hydroxide powder made from reacting quicklime with a controlled amount of water in a hydrator. It is used in chemical and industrial, construction, and environmental applications.'",' Domestic and world resources of limestone and dolomite suitable for lime manufacture are very large.',"'Limestone is a substitute for lime in many applications, such as agriculture, fluxing, and sulfur removal. Limestone, which contains less reactive material, is slower to react and may have other disadvantages compared with lime, depending on the application; however, limestone is considerably less expensive than lime. Calcined gypsum is an alternative material in industrial plasters and mortars. Cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, and lime kiln dust are potential substitutes for some construction uses of lime. Magnesium hydroxide is a substitute for lime in pH control, and magnesium oxide is a substitute for dolomitic lime as a flux in steelmaking.'"
