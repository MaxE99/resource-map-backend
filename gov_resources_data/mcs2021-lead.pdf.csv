1000 MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'Six lead mines in Missouri, plus four mines in Alaska and Idaho that produced lead as a principal product or byproduct, accounted for all domestic lead mine production. One mine in Washington closed after the current reserves were exhausted in 2019. The value of the lead in concentrates mined in 2020, based on the average North American Market price for refined lead, was about $574 million. Nearly all lead mine production has been exported since the last primary refinery closed in 2013. The 12 secondary refineries in 10 States accounted for more than 95% of the secondary lead produced in 2020. It was estimated that the lead-acid battery industry accounted for about 92% of reported U.S. lead consumption during 2020. Lead-acid batteries were primarily used as starting-lighting-ignition (SLI) batteries for automobiles, as industrial-type batteries for standby power for computer and telecommunications networks, and for motive power. During the first 7 months of 2020, 73 million lead-acid automotive batteries were shipped by North American producers, essentially unchanged from those shipped in the same period of 2019.'","'In 2020, about 1.1 million tons of secondary lead was produced, an amount equivalent to 73% of apparent domestic consumption. Nearly all secondary lead was recovered from old scrap, mostly lead-acid batteries.'","'During the first 10 months of 2020, the average LME cash price for lead was 81.5 cents per pound, 10% less than the average price in 2019. Global stocks of lead in LME-approved warehouses were 124,000 tons in October 2020, which was 88% more than those at yearend 2019. In 2020, domestic mine production was estimated to have increased by 6% from that in the previous year. However, domestic production of secondary lead decreased by 6% from that in the previous year. U.S. apparent consumption of refined lead decreased by 9% from that in the previous year. In the first 9 months of 2020, 19.7 million spent SLI lead-acid batteries were exported, slightly less than that in the same time period in 2019. According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group,6 global refined lead production in 2020 decreased by 4% to 11.7 million tons, and metal consumption decreased by 7% to 11.4 million tons. In 2020, the quarantine-related restrictions imposed as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic affected the mining industry in several countries, especially Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Peru.7 Consequently, world mine production fell by 7% in 2020 compared with the previous year.'","'Identified world lead resources total more than 2 billion tons. In recent years, significant lead resources have been identified in association with zinc and (or) silver or copper deposits in Australia, China, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Russia, and the United States (Alaska).'",'Substitution by plastics has reduced the use of lead in cable covering and cans. Tin has replaced lead in solder for potable water systems. The electronics industry has moved toward lead-free solders and flat-panel displays that do not require lead shielding. Steel and zinc are common substitutes for lead in wheel weights.'
