1000 MT,,2018.0,2019.0,2019.0,"'The total value of domestic natural soda ash (sodium carbonate) produced in 2019 was estimated to be about $1.8 billion and U.S. production of 12 million tons was about the same as that of the previous year. The U.S. soda ash industry comprised four companies in Wyoming operating five plants and one company in California with one plant. The five producing companies have a combined annual nameplate capacity of 13.9 million tons (15.3 million short tons). Borax, salt, and sodium sulfate were produced as coproducts of sodium carbonate production in California. Chemical caustic soda, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium sulfite were manufactured as coproducts at several of the Wyoming soda ash plants. Sodium bicarbonate was produced at an operation in Colorado using soda ash feedstock shipped from the companys Wyoming facility. Based on 2019 quarterly reports, the estimated distribution of soda ash by end use was glass, 47%; chemicals, 30%; distributors, 6%; soap and detergents, 6%; miscellaneous uses, 5%; flue gas desulfurization, 4%; pulp and paper, 1%; and water treatment, 1%. '","'No soda ash was recycled by producers; however, glass container producers use cullet glass, thereby reducing soda ash consumption.'","'Relatively low production costs and lower environmental impacts provide natural soda ash producers some advantage over producers of synthetic soda ash. The production of synthetic soda ash normally consumes more energy and releases more carbon dioxide than that of natural soda ash. In recent years, U.S. producers of natural soda ash were able to expand their markets when several synthetic soda ash plants were closed or idled around the world. Soda ash exports from Turkey increased in 2018 when a 2.5-million-ton-per-year plant opened all of its production lines after several months of operational delays. Some of the exports came to the United States starting in September 2018 and several more relatively large shipments were reported in 2019. Total production capacity in Turkey is estimated to be between 4 million and 5 million tons per year and soda ash shipments, especially for export, are expected to increase significantly during the next few years. Three groups dominate production and have become the worlds leading suppliers of soda ashAmerican National Soda Ash Corp., which represented three of the five domestic producers in 2019; multiple producers in China; and Solvay S.A. of Belgium. Increasing soda ash exports from Turkey may affect sales from these three groups. The United States likely will remain competitive with producers in China and Turkey for markets elsewhere in Asia. Asia and South America remain the most likely areas for increased soda ash consumption in the near future. U.S. producers expect modest growth in production and exports through 2020. '","'Natural soda ash is obtained from trona and sodium carbonate-rich brines. The worlds largest deposit of trona is in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. About 47 billion tons of identified soda ash resources could be recovered from the 56 billion tons of bedded trona and the 47 billion tons of interbedded or intermixed trona and halite, which are in beds more than 1.2 meters thick. Underground room-and-pillar mining, using conventional and continuous mining, is the primary method of mining Wyoming trona ore. This method has an average 45% mining recovery, whereas average recovery from solution mining is 30%. Improved solution-mining techniques, such as horizontal drilling to establish communication between well pairs, could increase this extraction rate and enable companies to develop some of the deeper trona beds. Wyoming trona resources are being depleted at the rate of about 15 million tons per year (8.3 million tons of soda ash). Searles Lake and Owens Lake in California contain an estimated 815 million tons of soda ash reserves. At least 95 natural sodium carbonate deposits have been identified in the world, only some of which have been quantified. Although soda ash can be manufactured from salt and limestone, both of which are practically inexhaustible, synthetic soda ash is costlier to produce and generates environmental wastes.'","'Caustic soda can be substituted for soda ash in certain uses, particularly in the pulp and paper, water treatment, and certain chemical sectors. Soda ash, soda liquors, or trona can be used as feedstock to manufacture chemical caustic soda, which is an alternative to electrolytic caustic soda.'"
