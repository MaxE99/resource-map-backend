1000 MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'Manganese ore containing 20% or more manganese has not been produced domestically since 1970. Manganese ore was consumed mainly by six firms with plants principally in the East and Midwest. Most ore consumption was related to steel production, either directly in pig iron manufacture or indirectly through upgrading the ore to ferroalloys. Manganese ferroalloys were produced at two plants. Additional quantities of ore were used for such nonmetallurgical purposes as production of dry cell batteries, in fertilizers and animal feed, and as a brick colorant.'","'Manganese was recycled incidentally as a constituent of ferrous and nonferrous scrap; however, scrap recovery specifically for manganese was negligible. Manganese is recovered along with iron from steel slag.'","'Steel production, the leading use of manganese, decreased across the globe in 2020 compared with production in 2019 owing to reduced demand attributed to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Global production of manganese ore was estimated to be about 6% less than that in 2019. The leading countries for manganese ore production were, in descending order on a contained-weight basis, South Africa, Australia, and Gabon. Total U.S. manganese imports were estimated to have decreased by approximately 30% in 2020 compared with those in 2019. By September 2020, average spot market prices for manganese ore from China had decreased by 16% compared with the annual average spot price in 2019.'","""' Land-based manganese resources are large but irregularly distributed; those in the United States are very low grade and have potentially high extraction costs. South Africa accounts for about 40% of the worlds manganese reserves, and Brazil accounts for about 20%.""",'Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications.'
