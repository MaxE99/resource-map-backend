MT,,2019,2020,"Wollastonite was mined by two companies in New York during 2020. U.S. production of wollastonite (sold or used by producers) was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data but was estimated to have remained essentially unchanged from that of 2019. Economic resources of wollastonite typically form as a result of thermal metamorphism of siliceous limestone during regional deformation or chemical alteration of limestone by siliceous hydrothermal fluids along faults or contacts with magmatic intrusions. Deposits of wollastonite have been identified in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Utah; however, New York is the only State where long-term continuous mining has taken place. The U.S. Geological Survey does not collect consumption statistics for wollastonite, but consumption was estimated to have decreased in 2020, compared with that of 2019. Ceramics (frits, sanitaryware, and tile), friction products (primarily brake linings), metallurgical applications (flux and conditioner), paint (architectural and industrial paints), plastics and rubber markets (thermoplastic and thermoset resins and elastomer compounds), and miscellaneous uses (including adhesives, concrete, glass, and sealants) accounted for wollastonite sales in the United States. In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing; increases green and fired strength; maintains brightness during firing; permits fast firing; and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and protects the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel. As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves resistance to weathering, reduces gloss and pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and suspending agent. In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength.",None.,"Construction starts of new housing units through July 2020, increased by 4.7% compared with those during the same period in 2019, suggesting that sales of wollastonite to domestic construction- related markets, such as adhesives, caulks, cement board, ceramic tile, paints, stucco, and wallboard, might have increased. However, sales of wollastonite to most other major markets in which wollastonite is used were estimated to have decreased. Owing to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, production of motor vehicles and parts, which contain wollastonite in friction products and plastic and rubber components, decreased in the first 7 months of 2020; plastics and rubber production decreased by 33% each; and primary iron and steel production decreased by 19% compared with those in the same period of 2019. Globally, ceramics, polymers (such as plastics and rubber), and paint accounted for most wollastonite sales. Lesser global uses for wollastonite included miscellaneous construction products, friction materials, metallurgical applications, and paper. Global sales of wollastonite were estimated to be in the range of 830,000 to 880,000 tons, slightly lower than those in 2019.","Reliable estimates of wollastonite resources do not exist for most countries. Large deposits of wollastonite have been identified in China, Finland, India, Mexico, and the United States. Smaller, but significant, deposits have been identified in Canada, Chile, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.","The acicular nature of many wollastonite products allows it to compete with other acicular materials, such as ceramic fiber, glass fiber, steel fiber, and several organic fibers, such as aramid, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene, in products where improvements in dimensional stability, flexural modulus, and heat deflection are sought. Wollastonite also competes with several nonfibrous minerals or rocks, such as kaolin, mica, and talc, which are added to plastics to increase flexural strength, and such minerals as barite, calcium carbonate, gypsum, and talc, which impart dimensional stability to plastics. In ceramics, wollastonite competes with carbonates, feldspar, lime, and silica as a source of calcium and silica. Its use in ceramics depends on the formulation of the ceramic body and the firing method."
