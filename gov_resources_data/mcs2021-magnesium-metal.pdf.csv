1000 MT,,2019,2020,"'In 2020, primary magnesium was produced by one company in Utah at an electrolytic process plant that recovered magnesium from brines from the Great Salt Lake. Secondary magnesium was recovered from scrap at plants that produced magnesium ingot and castings and from aluminum alloy scrap at secondary aluminum smelters. Primary magnesium production in 2020 was estimated to have decreased from that of 2019. Information regarding U.S. primary magnesium production was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The leading use for primary magnesium metal, which accounted for 47% of reported consumption, was in castings, principally used for the automotive industry. Aluminum-base alloys that were used for packaging, transportation, and other applications accounted for 33% of primary magnesium metal consumption; desulfurization of iron and steel, 16%; and all other uses, 4%. About 33% of the secondary magnesium was consumed for structural uses, and about 67% was used in aluminum alloys.'","'In 2020, about 25,000 tons of secondary magnesium was recovered from old scrap and 65,000 tons was recovered from new scrap. Aluminum-base alloys accounted for about 55% of the secondary magnesium recovered, and magnesium-based castings, ingot, and other materials accounted for about 45%.'","'The sole U.S. producer of primary magnesium temporarily shut down some capacity at the end of 2016 citing the shutdown of a titanium sponge plant that had been a major customer, and this capacity was not expected to restart in the foreseeable future. Prices and demand for magnesium fluctuated during much of the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The price in Europe spiked in February compared with the price at the end of January but then declined by mid-March. The price increase in Europe in February and early March was attributed to concerns that shutdowns of smelters in China would cause shortages of magnesium. During January and February, producers in China shut down some capacity citing travel and work restrictions, less demand because of the pandemic, and heavy snowfall in the northwest part of China. But as many secondary aluminum smelters and diecasters in Europe temporarily shut down production in February and March, magnesium consumption decreased. Prices in Europe decreased during April and May, on decreased demand, but increased in June. Decreased production in China during the summer months wascited for increased magnesium prices in Europe. In September, prices in Europe declined. In the United States, spot sales of magnesium declined dramatically in April and May, causing the price to drop. Diecasters producing parts for the automobile industry as well as secondary aluminum smelters decreased magnesium consumption in response to shutdowns of automobile assembly lines, aluminum extruders, and aluminum rolling mills. By midyear, consumption of magnesium by aluminum smelters and diecasters stabilized but prices remained at lower levels in the United States and dropped again in August. Producers in China dominate global magnesium metal production, but several projects were under development to increase primary magnesium metal capacity elsewhere and in China. In the United States, one company obtained a location to build a pilot plant to test magnesium production from a dolomite deposit in Nevada. A company in Quebec, Canada, started construction of a secondary magnesium smelter with completion expected by midyear 2021. Then the company planned to construct a primary magnesium smelter to produce magnesium from serpentine-bearing asbestos tailings. A company in Australia was planning to start construction in 2021 on a 3,000-ton-per-year plant to recover magnesium from coal fly ash with completion expected to take 18 months. The use of magnesium in automobile parts continued to increase as automobile manufacturers sought to decrease vehicle weight in response to consumer desires for increased fuel efficiency. Magnesium castings have substituted for aluminum, iron, and steel in some automobiles. The substitution of aluminum for steel in automobile sheet was expected to increase consumption of magnesium in aluminum alloy sheet. Although some magnesium sheet applications have been developed for automobiles, these were generally limited to expensive sports cars and luxury vehicles, automobiles where the higher price of magnesium is not a deterrent to its use.'","'Resources from which magnesium may be recovered range from large to virtually unlimited and are globally widespread. Resources of dolomite, serpentine, and magnesium-bearing evaporite minerals are enormous. Magnesium-bearing brines are estimated to constitute a resource in the billions of tons, and magnesium could be recovered from seawater along world coastlines.'","'Aluminum and zinc may substitute for magnesium in castings and wrought products. The relatively light weight of magnesium is an advantage over aluminum and zinc in castings and wrought products in most applications; however, its high cost is a disadvantage relative to these substitutes. For iron and steel desulfurization, calcium carbide may be used instead of magnesium. Magnesium is preferred to calcium carbide for desulfurization of iron and steel because calcium carbide produces acetylene in the presence of water.'"
