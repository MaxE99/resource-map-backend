MT,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'There has been no known domestic commercial production of tungsten concentrates since 2015. Approximately six companies in the United States used chemical processes to convert tungsten concentrates, ammonium paratungstate (APT), tungsten oxide, and (or) scrap to tungsten metal powder, tungsten carbide powder, and (or) tungsten chemicals. Nearly 60% of the tungsten used in the United States was used in cemented carbide parts for cutting and wear-resistant applications, primarily in the construction, metalworking, mining, and oil and gas drilling industries. The remaining tungsten was used to make various alloys and specialty steels; electrodes, filaments, wires, and other components for electrical, electronic, heating, lighting, and welding applications; and chemicals for various applications. The estimated value of apparent consumption in 2020 was approximately $500 million.'",'The estimated quantity of secondary tungsten produced and the amount consumed from secondary sources by processors and end users in 2020 were withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data.',"'World tungsten supply was dominated by production in China and exports from China. Chinas Government regulated its tungsten industry by limiting the number of mining and export licenses, imposing quotas on concentrate production, and placing constraints on mining and processing. In 2020, production of tungsten concentrate outside China was expected to remain at less than 20% of world production. Scrap continued to be an important source of raw material for the tungsten industry worldwide. China was the worlds leading tungsten consumer. Analysts forecast global tungsten consumption in 2020 will be less than that in 2019 as a result of the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and industrial production, particularly tungsten consuming end-use sectors such as the automotive, commercial aerospace, and oil and gas drilling industries. The decrease in tungsten consumption in 2020 is expected to result in a market surplus. During March and April 2020, most prices of tungsten concentrates and downstream tungsten materials decreased in response to reduced demand; prices then stabilized or gradually trended upward as the year progressed.'","'World tungsten resources are geographically widespread. China ranks first in the world in terms of tungsten resources and reserves and has some of the largest deposits. Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United States also have significant tungsten resources.'","'Potential substitutes for cemented tungsten carbides include cemented carbides based on molybdenum carbide, niobium carbide, or titanium carbide; ceramics; ceramic-metallic composites (cermets); and tool steels. Most of these options reduce, rather than replace, the amount of tungsten used. Potential substitutes for other applications are as follows: molybdenum for certain tungsten mill products; molybdenum steels for tungsten steels, although most molybdenum steels still contain tungsten; lighting based on carbon nanotube filaments, induction technology, and light-emitting diodes for lighting based on tungsten electrodes or filaments; depleted uranium or lead for tungsten or tungsten alloys in applications requiring high density or the ability to shield radiation; and depleted uranium alloys or hardened steel for cemented tungsten carbides or tungsten alloys in armor-piercing projectiles. In some applications, substitution would result in increased cost or a loss in product performance.'"
