MT,,2021,2022,"Arsenic trioxide and primary arsenic metal have not been produced in the United States since 1985. The principal use for arsenic compounds was in herbicides and insecticides. Arsenic trioxide was predominantly used for the production of arsenic acid, which is a key ingredient in the production of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) preservatives. CCA preservatives are used for the pressure treating of lumber for primarily nonresidential applications such as light poles, marine applications, and retaining walls. Seven companies produced CCA-treated wood in the United States in 2022. High-purity (99.9999%) arsenic metal was used to produce gallium-arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors for solar cells, space research, and telecommunications. High-purity arsenic also was used for germanium-arsenide-selenide specialty optical materials. Indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) was used for short-wave infrared technology. The grids in lead-acid storage batteries were strengthened by the addition of arsenic metal. Arsenic metal also was used as an antifriction additive for bearings, to harden lead shot, and in clip-on wheel weights. The value of arsenic compounds and metal imported domestically in 2022 was estimated to be about $8 million. Given that arsenic metal has not been produced domestically since 1985, it is likely that only a small portion of the material reported by the U.S. Census Bureau as arsenic exports was pure arsenic metal, and most of the material that was reported under this category reflects the gross weight of alloys, compounds, residues, scrap, and waste containing arsenic. Therefore, the estimated consumption reported under U.S. salient statistics reflects only imports of arsenic products. Globally, the leading uses of arsenic were as follows: herbicides and insecticides, 45%; wood preservatives, 29%; electronics, 8%; and other, 18%.","Arsenic metal was contained in new scrap recycled during GaAs semiconductor manufacturing. Arsenic- containing process water was internally recycled at wood treatment plants where CCA was used. Although scrap electronic circuit boards, relays, and switches may contain arsenic, no arsenic was known to have been recovered during the recycling process to recover other contained metals. No arsenic was recovered domestically from arsenic- containing residues and dusts generated at nonferrous smelters in the United States.","Peru, China, and Morocco, in descending order, continued to be the leading global producers of arsenic trioxide, accounting for about 93% of estimated world production in 2022. China and Morocco continued to supply about 93% of United States imports of arsenic trioxide in 2022. China was the leading world producer of arsenic metal and supplied about 97% of United States arsenic metal imports in 2022. High-purity arsenic metal was used to produce GaAs, indium-arsenide, and InGaAs semiconductors that were used in biomedical, communications, computer, electronics, and photovoltaic applications. Total revenues from GaAs devices increased in 2022 because of fifth-generation (5G) technology that became standard for broadband cellular 5G networks and consumer devices. A variety of GaAs wafer manufacturers ranging from large, multinational corporations to small, privately owned companies competed in this industry, but the top six producers accounted for more than 75% of the market.","Arsenic may be obtained from copper, gold, and lead smelter flue dust, as well as from roasting arsenopyrite, the most abundant ore mineral of arsenic. Arsenic has been recovered from orpiment and realgar in China, Peru, and the Philippines and from copper-gold ores in Chile, and arsenic is associated with gold occurrences in Canada. Orpiment and realgar from gold mines in Sichuan Province, China, were stockpiled for later recovery of arsenic. Arsenic also may be recovered from enargite, a copper mineral. Arsenic trioxide was produced at the hydrometallurgical complex of Guemassa, near Marrakech, Morocco, from cobalt-arsenide ore from the Bou Azzer Mine.","Substitutes for CCA in wood treatment include alkaline copper quaternary, ammoniacal copper quaternary, ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate, alkaline copper quaternary boron-based preservatives, copper azole, copper citrate, and copper naphthenate. Treated wood substitutes include concrete, plastic composite material, plasticized wood scrap, or steel. Silicon-based complementary metal-oxide semiconductor power amplifiers compete with GaAs power amplifiers in midtier third-generation cellular handsets. Indium phosphide components can be substituted for GaAs-based infrared laser diodes in some specific-wavelength applications, and helium-neon lasers compete with GaAs in visible laser diode applications. Silicon is the principal competitor with GaAs in solar-cell applications. In many defense-related applications, GaAs-based integrated circuits are used because of their unique properties, and no effective substitutes exist for GaAs in these applications. In heterojunction bipolar transistors, GaAs is being replaced in some applications by silicon-germanium."
