1000 MT,,2018,2019,"'Six companies produced silicon materials at seven plants, all east of the Mississippi River. Most ferrosilicon was consumed in the ferrous foundry and steel industries, predominantly in the Eastern United States, and was sourced primarily from domestic quartzite (silica). The main consumers of silicon metal were producers of aluminum alloys and the chemical industry. The semiconductor and solar energy industries, which manufacture chips for computers and photovoltaic cells from high-purity silicon, respectively, also consumed silicon metal.'",'Insignificant.',"'Combined domestic ferrosilicon and silicon metal production in 2019, expressed in terms of contained silicon, decreased from that of 2018. One producer idled a silicon metal production facility at the end of 2018 to consolidate operations and respond to reduced demand. Domestic production during the first 9 months of 2019 was about 19% less, on a gross-weight basis, than that during the same period in 2018. By September 2019, average U.S. ferrosilicon spot market prices had decreased slightly for 50%-grade ferrosilicon and by 14% for 75%- grade ferrosilicon compared with the annual average spot price in 2018. The average silicon metal spot market price had decreased by 18% compared with the annual average spot price in 2018. Oversupply in the market combined with decreased demand from ferrosilicon and silicon metal consumers contributed to declining prices in 2019. Excluding the United States, ferrosilicon accounted for about 55% of world silicon production on a silicon-content basis in 2019. Global production for 2018 was revised from the previous years publication owing to increases in the estimates for production from China. The leading countries for ferrosilicon production were, in descending order and on a contained-weight basis, China, Russia, and Norway. For silicon metal, the leading producers were China, Norway, and Brazil. China accounted for approximately 64% of total global estimated production of silicon materials in 2019.'","'World and domestic resources for making silicon metal and alloys are abundant and, in most producing countries, adequate to supply world requirements for many decades. The source of the silicon is silica in various natural forms, such as quartzite.'","'Aluminum, silicon carbide, and silicomanganese can be substituted for ferrosilicon in some applications. Gallium arsenide and germanium are the principal substitutes for silicon in semiconductor and infrared applications.'"
