1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021.0,"The estimated free on board (f.o.b.) mine value of marketable peat sold by producers in the conterminous United States was $14 million in 2021. Peat was harvested and processed by 29 companies in 11 conterminous States. Florida, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, and Minnesota were the leading producing States and accounted for 98% of peat sold. Reed-sedge peat accounted for approximately 87% of the total volume produced, followed by sphagnum moss with 10%. Domestic peat applications included earthworm culture medium, golf course construction, mixed fertilizers, mushroom culture, nurseries, packing for flowers and plants, seed inoculants, and vegetable cultivation. In the industrial sector, peat was used as an oil absorbent and as an efficient filtration medium for the removal of waterborne contaminants in mine waste streams, municipal storm drainage, and septic systems.",None.,"Peat is an important component of plant-growing media, and the demand for peat generally follows that of horticultural applications. In the United States, the short-term outlook is for production to average about 420,000 tons per year and imported peat from Canada is expected to continue to account for more than 80% of domestic consumption. Imports for 2021 were estimated to have increased to 1.7 million tons from 1.4 million tons in 2020, and exports were estimated to have decreased to about 38,000 tons from 46,000 tons in 2020. In 2021, peat stocks were estimated to have remained about the same as those in the previous year. Based on estimated world production for 2021, the worlds leading peat producers were, in descending order of production, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Latvia, Belarus, and Canada.In many parts of the world, concerns about climate change prompted several countries to plan to decrease or eliminate the use of peat, owing to peatlands ability to act as a carbon sink. Most of Irelands peat production ended in 2021, as the country transitioned to alternative fuel sources. Ireland continued to produce peat briquettes but was expected to stop by 2024. The countrys goal was to have at least 80% of its fossil-fuel sector employment transitioned to the renewable energy sector by 2025. In 2021, Finland continued to work toward its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2035. To achieve this, peat production was to be phased out in favor of other forms of noncarbon energy. In 2021, about 35% of Finlands energy consumption was supplied by peat and other fossil fuels. Several European countries, including Belarus, Ireland, and Sweden, were planning or implementing peatland restoration projects to help combat greenhouse-gas emissions and restore wildlife habitats. These initiatives were expected to decrease peat production across Europe in the future.","Peat is a renewable resource, continuing to accumulate on 60% of global peatlands. However, the volume of global peatlands has been decreasing at a rate of 0.05% annually owing to harvesting and land development. Many countries evaluate peat resources based on volume or area because the variations in densities and thickness of peat deposits make it difficult to estimate tonnage. Volume data have been converted using the average bulk density of peat produced in each of those countries. More than 50% of the U.S. peat resources are located in undisturbed areas of Alaska.","Natural organic materials, such as composted yard waste and coir (coconut fiber), compete with peat in horticultural applications. Shredded paper and straw are used to hold moisture for some grass-seeding applications. The superior water-holding capacity and physiochemical properties of peat limit substitution alternatives in most applications."
