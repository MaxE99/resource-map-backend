MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'Iron oxide pigments (IOPs) were mined domestically by two companies in Alabama and Georgia. Mine production, which was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data, remained about the same in 2021 as that in 2020. Five companies, including the two producers of natural IOPs, processed and sold about 18,000 tons of finished natural and synthetic |OPs with an estimated value of $13 million. About 48% of natural and synthetic finished IOPs were used in concrete and other construction materials; 17% in industrial chemicals; 14% in foundry sands and other foundry uses; 5% each in animal feed and paint and coatings; 3% each in plastics and glass and ceramics; and the remaining 5% in other uses.'",'None.',"'In 2021, domestic mine production of crude and finished natural IOPs remained approximately the same as 2020 production. Imports of natural and synthetic pigments were estimated to have increased by 10% in 2021, owing in part to low mortgage interest rates and increased demand for single-family homes as the global COVID-19 pandemic made multifamily homes less desirable. In the United States, residential construction, in which IOPs are commonly used to color concrete block and brick, ready-mixed concrete, and roofing tiles, increased during the first 9 months of 2021 compared with that in the same period in 2020. Housing starts increased by about 20% in 2021 compared with those in 2020. Exports of pigment-grade IOPs increased by 3% during the first 9 months of 2021 compared with those during the same period in 2020, mostly owing to an increase in exports to Argentina, Poland, and South Africa. Approximately 80% of pigment-grade IOPs exports went to Mexico, China, Germany, Thailand, Belgium, and Brazil, in descending order of quantity. Exports of other grades of iron oxides and hydroxides decreased by 25% during the first 9 months of 2021 compared with those in the same period in 2020. About 89% of exports of other grades of iron oxides and hydroxides went to Mexico, Canada, Ireland, Belgium, and the Republic of Korea, in descending order of quantity.'",'* Domestic and world resources for production of IOPs are adequate. Adequate resources are available worldwide for the manufacture of synthetic IOPs.',"'Milled |OPs are thought to be the most commonly used natural minerals for pigments. Because IOPs are color stable, low cost, and nontoxic, they can be economically used for imparting black, brown, red, and yellow coloring in large and relatively low-value applications. Other minerals may be used as colorants, but they generally cannot compete with IOPs because of their higher costs and more limited availability. Synthetic IOPs are widely used as colorants and compete with natural IOPs in many color applications. Organic colorants are used for some colorant applications, but many of the organic compounds fade over time from exposure to sunlight.'"
