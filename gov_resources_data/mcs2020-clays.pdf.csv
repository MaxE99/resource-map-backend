1000 MT,,2018,2019,2018,2019,2018,2019,"'Production of clays (sold or used) in the United States was estimated to be 26 million tons valued at $1.8 billion in 2019, with about 145 companies operating clay and shale mines in 40 States. The leading 20 firms produced approximately 50% of the U.S. tonnage and 85% of the value for all types of clay. Principal uses for specific clays were estimated to be as follows: ball clay50% floor and wall tile and 15% sanitaryware; bentonite52% pet waste absorbents and 31% drilling mud; common clay34% brick, 29% lightweight aggregate, and 24% cement; fire clay70% heavy clay products (for example, brick and cement) and 30% refractory products and miscellaneous uses; fullers earth98% pet waste absorbents; and kaolin60% paper coating and filling, 12% paint, and 9% catalysts. Lightweight ceramic proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing are also a significant market for kaolin, but data were insufficient to estimate market size. Exports of clay and shale were estimated to have increased by 4% in 2019 after remaining essentially unchanged in 2018. In 2019, the United States exported 820,000 tons of bentonite mainly for pet waste absorbent, drilling mud, foundry sand bond, and iron ore pelletizing applications, with Canada, Japan, and Mexico being the leading destinations. About 2.5 million tons of kaolin were exported mainly as a paper coating and filler; a component in ceramic bodies; and fillers and extenders in paint, plastic, and rubber products, with China, Japan, and Mexico being the leading destinations. Lesser quantities of ball clay, fire clay, and fullers earth were exported for ceramic, refractory, and absorbent uses, respectively.'",'Insignificant.',"'Total U.S. sales of clays decreased slightly in 2018 and again in 2019 compared with those of the previous year. Over the past 2 years, other industrial minerals associated with construction activity have been estimated to have increased. Ball clay and common clay experienced decreases during this period and sales of bentonite increased in 2018 and were essentially unchanged in 2019.'",'Resources of all clays are extremely large.',"'Clays compete with calcium carbonate in filler and extender applications; diatomite, organic pet litters, polymers, silica gel, and zeolites as absorbents; and various siding and roofing types in building construction.'"
