1000 MT,,2021.0,2022.0,"'Approximately 2.5 million tons of dimension stone, valued at $520 million, was sold or used by U.S. producers in 2022. Dimension stone was produced by approximately 200 companies operating 231 quarries in 34 States. Leading producing States were, in descending order by tonnage, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Vermont. These four States accounted for about 68% of the production quantity and contributed about 58% of the value of domestic production. Approximately 49%, by tonnage, of dimension stone sold or used was limestone, followed by granite (19%), sandstone (18%), dolomite and slate (4% each), and the remaining 6% was divided, in descending order of tonnage, among marble, traprock, miscellaneous stone, and quartzite. By value, the leading sales or uses were for limestone (47%), followed by granite (26%), sandstone (10%), and marble and slate (5% each); the remaining 7% was divided, in descending order of total value, among dolomite, traprock, quartzite, and miscellaneous stone. Rough stone represented 59% of the tonnage and 56% of the value of all the dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, including exports. The leading uses and distribution of rough stone, by tonnage, were in building and construction (66%) and in irregular-shaped stone (26%). The leading uses and distribution of dressed stone, by tonnage, were in ashlars and partially squared pieces (43%), curbing (13%), slabs and blocks for building and construction (10%), and flagging (9%). '","'Small amounts of dimension stone were recycled, principally by restorers of old stone work.'","'The United States remained one of the worlds leading markets for dimension stone. In 2022, total imports of dimension stone increased in value by about 9% compared with those in 2021. The dimension stone market continued to recover to pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic levels, with production having steadily increased since 2020. In 2022, dimension stone exports increased by 4% to about $49 million. Apparent consumption, by value, was estimated to be $2.9 billion in 2022an 11% increase compared with that in 2021. The dimension stone industry continued to be concerned with safety and health regulations and environmental restrictions in 2022, especially those concerning crystalline silica exposure. In 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration finalized new regulations to further restrict exposure to crystalline silica at quarry sites and other industrial operations that use materials containing it. Final implementation of the new regulations took effect in 2021, affecting various industries that use materials containing silica. Most provisions of the new regulations became enforceable on June 23, 2018, for general industry and maritime operations. '",' Dimension stone resources of the world are sufficient. Resources can be limited on a local level or occasionally on a regional level by the lack of a particular kind of stone that is suitable for dimension purposes.',"'Substitutes for dimension stone include aluminum, brick, ceramic tile, concrete, glass, plastics, resin- agglomerated stone, and steel.'"
