MT,,2019,2020,2019,"2020","'Fused aluminum oxide was produced by two companies at three plants in the United States and Canada. Production of crude fused aluminum oxide had an estimated value of $1.7 million. Silicon carbide was produced by two companies at two plants in the United States. Production of crude silicon carbide had an estimated value of about $26 million. Metallic abrasives were produced by 11 companies in eight States. Production of metallic abrasives had an estimated value of about $120 million. Bonded and coated abrasive products accounted for most abrasive uses of fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide. Metallic abrasives are used primarily for steel shot and grit and cut wire shot, which are used for sandblasting, peening, and stonecutting applications.'","'Up to 30% of fused aluminum oxide may be recycled, and about 5% of silicon carbide is recycled.'","'In 2020, China was the worlds leading producer of abrasive fused aluminum oxide and abrasive silicon carbide. Imports, especially from China where operating costs were lower, continued to challenge abrasives producers in the United States and Canada. In recent years, imports of abrasives from Hong Kong have also increased. Foreign competition is expected to persist and continue to limit production in North America. The average unit value of imports had increased every year since 2016 for regular fused aluminum oxide and crude silicon carbide but decreased in 2020. The average unit values of imports of regular fused aluminum oxide and crude silicon carbide during the first 6 months of 2020 were 6% and 16% lower, respectively, than those in 2019 and 3% and 5% higher, respectively, than those in 2018. Abrasives consumption in the United States is greatly influenced by activity in the manufacturing sectors, particularly the aerospace, automotive, furniture, housing, and steel industries. Steel grit can be reclaimed and used multiple times. The use of reclaimed metallic abrasives increased, at least in part, owing to rising surcharges on scrap and waste disposal and increasing prices for new material. In 2020, the abrasives manufacturing industry was considered part of the critical manufacturing sector by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders issued in March 2020 did not affect the abrasives manufacturing industry, and these plants maintained full operations. However, imports and exports for fused aluminum oxide decreased by 29% and 24%, respectively, from those in 2019.'","' Although domestic resources of raw materials for the production of fused aluminum oxide are rather limited, adequate resources are available in the Western Hemisphere. Domestic resources are more than adequate for the production of silicon carbide.'","'Natural and manufactured abrasives, such as garnet, emery, or metallic abrasives, can be substituted for fused aluminum oxide and silicon carbide in various applications.'"
