MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'Significant U.S. tantalum mine production has not been reported since 1959. Domestic tantalum resources are of low grade, some are mineralogically complex, and most are not commercially recoverable. Companies in the United States produced tantalum alloys, capacitors, carbides, compounds, and tantalum metal from imported tantalum ores and concentrates and tantalum-containing materials. Tantalum metal and alloys were recovered from foreign and domestic scrap. Domestic tantalum consumption was not reported by consumers. Major end uses for tantalum included alloys for gas turbines used in the aerospace and oil and gas industries; tantalum capacitors for automotive electronics, mobile accessories, and personal computers; tantalum carbides for cutting and boring tools; and tantalum oxide (Ta2Os) was used in glass lenses to make lighter weight camera lenses that produce a brighter image. The value of tantalum consumed in 2022 was estimated to exceed $320 million as measured by the value of imports.'","'Tantalum was recycled mostly from new scrap that was generated during the manufacture of tantalum- containing electronic components and from tantalum-containing cemented carbide and superalloy scrap. The amount of tantalum recycled was not available, but it may account for as much as 30% of consumption by domestic primary processors.'","'U.S. tantalum apparent consumption was estimated to have increased by 66% from that in 2021. In 2022, estimated U.S. imports for consumption increased by 25%. The tantalum imported was in the form of waste and scrap (42%), metal and powder (37%), and ores and concentrates (21%). Waste and scrap imports had the most significant increase, more than doubling from those in 2021. Estimated U.S. exports decreased by 24% in 2022. In 2022, the average monthly price of tantalum ore was valued at $150 per kilogram of TazOs content, a decrease of 5% compared with that in 2021. Global tantalum production and consumption were estimated to have increased in 2022 as steel production in most countries continued to rebound from decreases owing to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic. Buyers sought more raw material supplies after maintaining low stocks in 2021 and there was increased demand from the electronics industry. In 2022, China remained the leading export destination and accounted for approximately 20% of tantalum ores and concentrates, waste and scrap, and metals consumption. Brazil, Congo (Kinshasa), Nigeria, and Rwanda accounted for about 85% of estimated global tantalum production in 2022. '","'""Identified world resources of tantalum, most of which are in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and China are considered adequate to supply projected needs. The United States has about 55,000 tons of tantalum resources in identified deposits, most of which were considered subeconomic at 2022 prices for tantalum.'","'The following materials can be substituted for tantalum, but a performance loss or higher costs may ensue: niobium and tungsten in carbides; aluminum, ceramics, and niobium in electronic capacitors; glass, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, platinum, stainless steel, titanium, and zirconium in corrosion-resistant applications; and hafnium, iridium, molybdenum, niobium, rhenium, and tungsten in high-temperature applications.'"
