1000 MT,,2021,2022,2022.0,"'The estimated free on board (f.0.b.) mine value of marketable peat sold by producers in the conterminous United States was approximately $10 million in 2022. Peat was harvested and processed by 28 companies in 11 of the conterminous United States. Florida was the leading producing State. The other leading producing States were Illinois, Maine, Michigan, and Minnesota, and these top five States accounted for 98% of peat sold. Reed-sedge peat accounted for approximately 87% of the total volume produced, followed by sphagnum moss with 10%. Domestic peat applications included earthworm culture medium, golf course construction, mixed fertilizers, mushroom culture, nurseries, packing for flowers and plants, seed inoculants, and vegetable cultivation. In the industrial sector, peat was used as an oil absorbent and as an efficient filtration medium for the removal of waterborne contaminants in mine waste streams, municipal storm drainage, and septic systems.'",'None.',"'Peat is an important component of plant-growing media, and the demand for peat generally follows that of horticultural applications. In the United States, the short-term outlook was for production to average about 350,000 tons per year, and imported peat from Canada was expected to continue to account for more than 80% of domestic consumption. Imports for 2022 were estimated to have decreased to 1.5 million tons from 1.6 million tons in 2021, and exports were estimated to have remained about the same as those in 2021 at 37,000 tons. In 2022, peat stocks were estimated to have increased to approximately 290,000 tons from 235,000 tons in 2021. Based on estimated world production for 2022, the worlds leading peat producers were, in descending order of production, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Latvia, Belarus, and Canada. In many parts of the world, concerns about climate change prompted several countries to plan to decrease or eliminate the use of peat, owing to peatlands ability to act as a carbon sink. Irelands peat production ended in 2021, as the country transitioned to alternative fuel sources. Ireland continued to produce peat briquettes but was expected to stop by 2024. Irish horticultural growers are importing peat to compensate for the lack of a domestic supply. Peat alternatives are currently not able to provide comparable crop yields in terms of growing quality and quantity. Finland continued to work toward its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2035. To achieve this, peat production was to be phased out in favor of other forms of noncarbon energy. In 2022, only about 14% of Finlands energy consumption was supplied by peat and other fossil fuels. About 53% of Finlands energy supply was generated using renewable energy sources, whereas 33% was produced by nuclear energy. Several European countries, including Belarus, Ireland, Scotland, and Sweden, were planning or implementing peatland restoration projects to help combat greenhouse-gas emissions and restore wildlife habitats. In August 2022, the United Kingdom announced a ban on peat sales to amateur gardeners by 2024 in an effort to protect peatlands. These initiatives were expected to decrease peat production across Europe in the future.'","'* Peat is a renewable resource, continuing to accumulate on 60% of global peatlands. However, the volume of global peatlands has been decreasing at a rate of 0.05% per year owing to harvesting and land development. Many countries evaluate peat resources based on volume or area because the variations in densities and thickness of peat deposits make it difficult to estimate tonnage. Volume data have been converted using the average bulk density of peat produced in each of those countries. More than 50% of the U.S. peat resources are located in undisturbed areas of Alaska.'","'Natural organic materials, such as composted yard waste and coir (coconut fiber), compete with peat in horticultural applications. Shredded paper and straw are used to hold moisture for some grass-seeding applications. The superior water-holding capacity and physiochemical properties of peat limit substitution alternatives in most applications.'"
