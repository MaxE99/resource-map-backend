1000 MT,,2021,2022,"'In 2022, recovered elemental sulfur and byproduct sulfuric acid were produced at 93 operations in 27 States. Total shipments were valued at about $1.3 billion. Elemental sulfur production was estimated to be 8.0 million tons; Louisiana and Texas accounted for about 46% of domestic production. Elemental sulfur was recovered, in descending order of tonnage, at petroleum refineries, natural-gas-processing plants, and coking plants by 34 companies at 88 plants in 26 States. Byproduct sulfuric acid, representing about 7% of production of sulfur in all forms, was recovered at five nonferrous-metal smelters in four States by four companies. Domestic elemental sulfur accounted for 65% of domestic consumption, and byproduct sulfuric acid accounted for about 5%. The remaining 30% of sulfur consumed was provided by imported sulfur and sulfuric acid. About 90% of sulfur consumed was in the form of sulfuric acid.'","'Typically, between 2.5 million and 5 million tons of spent sulfuric acid is reclaimed from petroleum refining and chemical processes during any given year.'","'Total U.S. sulfur production in 2022 was estimated to have increased by 7% from that in 2021, and shipments increased by 5% from those in 2021. Domestic production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refineries and recovery from natural gas operations increased by 7%. Domestically, refinery sulfur production is expected to remain about the same as refining utilization remains high. Domestic byproduct sulfuric acid is expected to remain relatively constant, unless one or more of the remaining nonferrous-metal smelters close. Domestic phosphate rock consumption in 2022 was estimated to have decreased from that in 2021, which resulted in the lower consumption of sulfur to process the phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizers. New sulfur demand associated with phosphate fertilizer projects is expected mostly in Africa and east Asia. World sulfur production was unchanged compared with that in 2021. In 2022, world sulfur supplies were hampered by a decrease in the sulfur trade in part related to sanctions on Russia. However, sulfur production from the Middle East will increase sulfur availability. Also, an increase in nickel production to produce battery materials will increase sulfur demand. Contract sulfur prices in Tampa, FL, began 2022 at around $282 per long ton. The sulfur price increased to $481 per long ton in early April, and then decreased to $352 per long ton in mid-July. Fourth-quarter 2022 prices were $90 per long ton. In the past few years, sulfur prices have been variable, a result of the volatility in the demand for sulfur. High sulfur prices in 2022 were a result of supply issues. '","'Resources of elemental sulfur in evaporite and volcanic deposits, and sulfur associated with natural gas, petroleum, tar sands, and metal sulfides, total about 5 billion tons. The sulfur in gypsum and anhydrite is almost limitless, and 600 billion tons of sulfur is contained in coal, oil shale, and shale that is rich in organic matter. Production from these sources would require development of low-cost methods of extraction. The domestic sulfur resource is about one-fifth of the world total.'","'Substitutes for sulfur at present or anticipated price levels are not satisfactory; some acids, in certain applications, may be substituted for sulfuric acid, but usually at a higher cost.'"
