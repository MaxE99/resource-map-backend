1000 MT,,2020,2021,2020,2021,"'In 2021, U.S. portland cement production increased slightly to an estimated 90 million tons, and masonry cement production continued to remain steady at 2.4 million tons. Cement was produced at 96 plants in 34 States, and at 2 plants in Puerto Rico. Texas, Missouri, California, and Florida were, in descending order of production, the four leading cement-producing States and accounted for nearly 44% of U.S. production. Overall, the U.S. cement industrys growth continued to be constrained by closed or idle plants, underutilized capacity at others, production disruptions from plant upgrades, and relatively inexpensive imports. In 2021, shipments of cement were estimated to have increased slightly from those of 2020 and were valued at $13.4 billion. In 2021, an estimated 70% to 75% of sales were to ready-mixed concrete producers, 11% to concrete product manufacturers, 8% to 10% to contractors, and 5% to 12% to other customer types.'","'Cement is not recycled, but significant quantities of concrete are recycled for use as a construction aggregate. Cement kilns can use waste fuels, recycled cement kiln dust, and recycled raw materials such as slags and fly ash. Various secondary materials can be incorporated as supplementary cementitious materials (GCMs) in blended cements and in the cement paste in concrete.'","'The value of total construction put in place in the United States increased by about 7% during the first 9 months of 2021 compared with that in the same period in 2020. Residential construction spending increased, but nonresidential construction spending decreased. Despite weather-related declines in the beginning of the year, cement shipments increased slightly during the first 9 months of 2021 compared with those in the same period in 2020. The leading cement-consuming States continued to be Texas, California, and Florida, in descending order by tonnage. The increase in cement shipments was attributed to economic recovery from the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, growth continued to be constrained by increased costs for material and service inputs, labor and production shortages, ongoing logistical and shipping issues, and supply chain disruptions. The November 2021 passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was projected to support increased cement consumption. Company merger-and-acquisition activity continued in 2021, with the final approval to combine the North American cement operations of a Brazilian cement company and a Canadian cement company into a joint venture. One United States cement company completed its purchase of a European cement companys western United States operations, and a Swiss cement company acquired a United States building products company. In 2019, one European cement company entered into an agreement to purchase a Mexican cement companys plant in Pennsylvania, but the transaction was abandoned after being challenged by regulatory authorities in 2021. Cement plant upgrades were well underway at cement plants in Alabama and Indiana, with completion expected in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Several minor upgrades were ongoing at some other domestic plants, and upgrades also were announced for a few cement terminals. Numerous companies continued to make announcements aligned with the industrys commitment to sustainability, such as new blended cement product lines, renewable energy plans, decarbonization research initiatives, and other innovations. Many plants have installed emissions-reduction equipment to comply with the 2010 National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). It remains possible that some kilns could be shut, idled, or used in a reduced capacity to comply with NESHAP, which would constrain U.S. clinker capacity. '",'Not applicable. See Crushed Stone for cement raw-material resources.',"'Most portland cement is used to make concrete, mortars, or stuccos, and competes in the construction sector with concrete substitutes, such as aluminum, asphalt, clay brick, fiberglass, glass, gypsum (plaster), steel, stone, and wood. Certain materials, especially fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag, develop good hydraulic cementitious properties by reacting with lime, such as that released by the hydration of portland cement. Where readily available (including as imports), these SCMs are increasingly being used as partial substitutes for portland cement in many concrete applications and are components of finished blended cements.'"
