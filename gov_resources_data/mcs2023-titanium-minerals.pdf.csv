A second company processed existing mine tailings to recover a mixed heavy-mineral concentrate in California. Based on reported data through September, the estimated value of titanium mineral and synthetic concentrates imported into the United States in 2022 was $780 million. Abrasive sands, monazite, and zircon were coproducts of domestic titanium minerals mining operations. More than 95% of titanium mineral concentrates were consumed by domestic TiOz pigment producers. The remainder was used in welding-rod coatings and for manufacturing carbides, chemicals, and titanium metal.'",'None.',"'Consumption of titanium mineral concentrates is tied to production of TiO2 pigments that are primarily used in paint, paper, and plastics. Demand for these primary uses is related to changes in the gross domestic product. Domestic apparent consumption of titanium mineral concentrates in 2022 was estimated to have been unchanged from that in 2021. Inventory changes were not included in the apparent consumption calculation. Exports of titanium mineral concentrates increased significantly owing to increased recovery from mine tailings.'","'? Ilmenite accounts for about 90% of the worlds consumption of titanium minerals. World resources of anatase, ilmenite, and rutile total more than 2 billion tons.'","'Il menite, leucoxene, rutile, slag, and synthetic rutile compete as feedstock sources for producing TiOz pigment, titanium metal, and welding-rod coatings.'"
