1000 MT,,2021,2022,"'Domestic production of salt was estimated at 42 million tons in 2022, essentially unchanged compared with that in 2021. The total value of salt sold or used was estimated to be $2.5 billion, a slight increase from $2.4 billion in 2021. Salt was produced by 26 companies that operated 64 plants in 16 States. The top producing States were Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Utah. These seven States produced about 94% of the salt in the United States in 2022. The estimated percentage of salt sold or used was, by type, rock salt, 43%; salt in brine, 40%; vacuum pan salt, 9%; and solar salt, 8%. Highway deicing accounted for about 42% of total salt consumed. The chemical industry accounted for about 39% of total salt sales, with salt in brine accounting for 91% of the salt used for chemical feedstock. Chlorine and caustic soda manufacturers were the main consumers within the chemical industry. The remaining markets for salt were distributors, 9%; food processing, 4%; agricultural, 3%; general industrial, 2%; and primary water treatment, 1%. '",'None.',"'Demand for salt in 2022 remained lower than 2019 levels after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected production and consumption of salt throughout the world in 2020 and 2021. Increased energy costs also negatively affected salt markets as increased processing and especially transportation costs negatively affected the ability to import and export salt at competitive prices for some international transactions. For much of the 202122 winter, temperatures were near or above average with lower or average precipitation throughout most of the traditional U.S. snowbelt. The number of winter weather events including freezing rain, sleet, and snow is a better predictor of demand for rock salt than total snowfall. Several low snowfall or icing events usually require more salt for highway deicing than a single large snowfall event. Rock salt production and imports in 2022 were estimated to be near or slightly less than those in 2021 because demand from many local and State transportation departments were essentially unchanged from the previous year.For the 202223 winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a La Nia weather pattern for the third consecutive year. A strong La Nia historically favors an average to warmer temperature pattern, but a moderate La Nia favors a colder winter. Based on several factors, the forecasts slightly favor higher precipitation winter than a normal winter for the Midwest, interior Northeast along the Canadian border, and northwestern area of the United States. Within this area, only the upper Midwest and the northwestern area of the United States were predicted to experience below average temperatures. A warmer and drier pattern than average was predicted for the southern area of the United States. These forecasts would indicate that demand for rock salt could increase slightly in the upper the Midwest and northwestern areas of the United States but decrease in the northeastern United States. Demand for salt brine used in the chloralkali industry was expected to increase in 2023 as demand for caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride increases globally, especially in Asia. Salt exports from Australia and especially India have increased in recent years to meet the increasing demand in China, but tensions between China and both countries could affect trade. '","'World continental resources of salt are vast, and the salt content in the oceans is nearly unlimited. Domestic resources of rock salt and salt from brine are primarily in Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Texas. Saline lakes and solar evaporation salt facilities are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah. Almost every country in the world has salt deposits or solar evaporation operations of various sizes.'","'No economic substitutes or alternatives for salt exist in most applications. Calcium chloride and calcium magnesium acetate, hydrochloric acid, and potassium chloride can be substituted for salt in deicing, certain chemical processes, and food flavoring, but at a higher cost.'"
