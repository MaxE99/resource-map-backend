1000 MT,,2020,2021,"'In 2021, recovered elemental sulfur and byproduct sulfuric acid were produced at 95 operations in 27 States. Total shipments were valued at about $740 million. Elemental sulfur production was estimated to be 7.5 million tons; Louisiana and Texas accounted for about 55% of domestic production. Elemental sulfur was recovered, in descending order of tonnage, at petroleum refineries, natural-gas-processing plants, and coking plants by 35 companies at 90 plants in 26 States. Byproduct sulfuric acid, representing about 7% of production of sulfur in all forms, was recovered at five nonferrous-metal smelters in four States by four companies. Domestic elemental sulfur provided 59% of domestic consumption, and byproduct sulfuric acid accounted for about 5%. The remaining 36% of sulfur consumed was provided by imported sulfur and sulfuric acid. About 90% of sulfur consumed was in the form of sulfuric acid.'","'Typically, between 2.5 million and 5 million tons of spent sulfuric acid is reclaimed from petroleum refining and chemical processes during any given year.'","'Total U.S. sulfur production in 2021 was estimated to have increased by 3% from that of 2020, and shipments also increased by 4% from those of 2020. Domestic production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refineries and recovery from natural gas operations increased by 3%. However, in the first 6 months of 2021, U.S. sulfur production was lower than 2020 because of the cold weather that affected the central United States in mid-February, leading to the largest reduction in Gulf Coast refining operations over the past several years. In addition, Hurricanes Ida and Nicholas brought Gulf Coast refining to a standstill. Domestically, refinery sulfur production is expected to increase as refining utilization increases. Domestic byproduct sulfuric acid is expected to remain relatively constant, unless one or more of the remaining nonferrous-metal smelters close. Domestic phosphate rock consumption in 2021 was estimated to have remained the same as that in 2020, which resulted in the same consumption of sulfur to process the phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizers. World sulfur production was slightly more than it was in 2020 as a result of increased demand and is likely to steadily increase for the foreseeable future. New sulfur demand associated with phosphate fertilizer projects is expected mostly in Africa, and sulfur demand likely will also increase in Asia and Eastern Europe. Contract sulfur prices in Tampa, FL, began 2021 at around $69 per long ton. The sulfur price decreased to $195 per long ton in mid-July, and then decreased to $183 per long ton by the end of September. Fourth-quarter 2021 prices remained at $183 per long ton. In the past few years, sulfur prices have been variable, a result of the volatility in the demand for sulfur. High sulfur prices in 2021 were a result of supply issues. '","'Resources of elemental sulfur in evaporite and volcanic deposits, and sulfur associated with natural gas, petroleum, tar sands, and metal sulfides, total about 5 billion tons. The sulfur in gypsum and anhydrite is almost limitless, and 600 billion tons of sulfur is contained in coal, oil shale, and shale that is rich in organic matter. Production from these sources would require development of low-cost methods of extraction. The domestic sulfur resource is about one-fifth of the world total.'","'Substitutes for sulfur at present or anticipated price levels are not satisfactory; some acids, in certain applications, may be substituted for sulfuric acid, but usually at a higher cost.'"
