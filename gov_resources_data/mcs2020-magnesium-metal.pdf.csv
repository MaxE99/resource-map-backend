1000 MT,,2018,2019,"'In 2019, primary magnesium was produced by one company in Utah at an electrolytic process plant that recovered magnesium from brines from the Great Salt Lake. Secondary magnesium was recovered from scrap at plants that produced magnesium ingot and castings, and from aluminum alloy scrap at secondary aluminum smelters. Primary magnesium production in 2019 was estimated to have decreased from that of 2018. Information regarding U.S. primary magnesium production was withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. The leading use for primary magnesium metal, which accounted for 55% of reported consumption, was in castings, principally used for the automotive industry. Aluminum-base alloys that were used for packaging, transportation, and other applications accounted for 28% of primary magnesium metal consumption; desulfurization of iron and steel, 13%; and other uses, 4%. About 33% of the secondary magnesium was consumed for structural uses and about 67% was used in aluminum alloys.'","'In 2019, about 25,000 tons of secondary magnesium was recovered from old scrap and 85,000 tons were recovered from new scrap. Aluminum-base alloys accounted for 67% of the secondary magnesium recovered, and magnesium-based castings, ingot, and other materials accounted for about 33%.'","'The sole U.S. producer of primary magnesium temporarily shut down some capacity at the end of 2016 citing the shutdown of a titanium sponge plant that had been a major customer, and this capacity was not expected to restart in the foreseeable future. In May, the U.S. Department of Commerce assigned a preliminary countervailing duty rate of 7.48% on magnesium produced by one company in Israel. In July, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued a preliminary determination that magnesium produced by the same company in Israel would be subject to an antidumping duty rate of 193.24%. In November, an affirmative final determination was announced that found magnesium from Israel was sold at less than fair value in the United States. The final determinations on the antidumping and countervailing duty rates were expected in January 2020. The investigations into magnesium imports from Israel were initiated in November 2018 after a complaint was filed by the sole domestic primary magnesium producer. The investigations and preliminary determinations were cited for price increases and tight supplies of magnesium throughout the year.'","'Resources from which magnesium may be recovered range from large to virtually unlimited and are globally widespread. Resources of dolomite, serpentine, and magnesium-bearing evaporite minerals are enormous. Magnesium-bearing brines are estimated to constitute a resource in the billions of tons, and magnesium could be recovered from seawater along world coastlines.'","'Aluminum and zinc may substitute for magnesium in castings and wrought products. The relatively light weight of magnesium is an advantage over aluminum and zinc in castings and wrought products in most applications; however, its high cost is a disadvantage relative to these substitutes. For iron and steel desulfurization, calcium carbide may be used instead of magnesium. Magnesium is preferred to calcium carbide for desulfurization of iron and steel because calcium carbide produces acetylene in the presence of water.'"
