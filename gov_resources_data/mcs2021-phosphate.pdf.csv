1000 MT,,2019,2020,2020,"'In 2020, phosphate rock ore was mined by five firms at 10 mines in four States and processed into an estimated 24 million tons of marketable product, valued at $1.7 billion, free on board (f.0.b.) mine. Florida and North Carolina accounted for more than 75% of total domestic output; the remainder was produced in Idaho and Utah. Marketable product refers to beneficiated phosphate rock with phosphorus pentoxide (P2Os) content suitable for phosphoric acid or elemental phosphorus production. More than 95% of the phosphate rock mined in the United States was used to manufacture wet-process phosphoric acid and superphosphoric acid, which were used as intermediate feedstocks in the manufacture of granular and liquid ammonium phosphate fertilizers and animal feed supplements. Approximately 50% of the wet-process phosphoric acid produced was exported in the form of upgraded granular diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer, and merchant-grade phosphoric acid. The balance of the phosphate rock mined was for the manufacture of elemental phosphorus, which was used to produce phosphorus compounds for industrial applications, primarily glyphosate herbicide.'",'None.',"'The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a major effect on the domestic phosphate rock market in 2020. The fertilizer industry and related agricultural businesses were considered essential industries in the United States and most other countries. U.S. consumption and production of phosphate rock were estimated to have increased slightly in 2020, owing to a slight increase in phosphoric acid and combined DAP and MAP production. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, approved an expansion to the largest phosphate rock mine in Idaho. The expansion will allow the operating company to continue mining at the site for about 10 years, after which it will shift mining to a new mine that is under development in the same area. A new phosphate rock mine began operation near Spanish Forks, UT, in July 2020. The operating company will market its phosphate rock for direct application to soil for organic farming. Production initially was to be about 5,000 tons per year, eventually increasing to 48,000 tons per year after 5 years. The mine site was developed in the early 1980s by another company, but the project was cancelled after 2 years. According to industry analysts, the rated capacity of global phosphate rock mines was projected to increase to 261 million tons in 2024 from 238 million tons in 2020, including production of marketable phosphate rock in China of between 80 million and 85 million tons per year, compared with official production statistics of 90 million to 95 million tons per year that included some crude ore production. Most of the increases in production capacity were planned for Africa and the Middle East, where major expansion projects were in progress in Algeria, Egypt, Guinea Bissau, Morocco, Senegal, and Togo.World consumption of P2O5 contained in fertilizer and industrial uses was projected to increase to 49 million tons in 2024 from 47 million tons in 2020. Asia and South America are projected to be the leading regions of growth. U.S. consumption of contained P2O5 has remained steady at about 4 million tons per year over the past decade. '","'Some world reserves were reported only in terms of ore tonnage and grade. Phosphate rock resources occur principally as sedimentary marine phosphorites. The largest sedimentary deposits are found in northern Africa, China, the Middle East, and the United States. Significant igneous occurrences are found in Brazil, Canada, Finland, Russia, and South Africa. Large phosphate resources have been identified on the continental shelves and on seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. World resources of phosphate rock are more than 300 billion tons. There are no imminent shortages of phosphate rock.'",'There are no substitutes for phosphorus in agriculture.'
