MT,"Yttrium is one of the rare-earth elements. Bastnaesite (or bastnsite), a rare-earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined in 2020 as a primary product at the Mountain Pass Mine in California, which was restarted in the first quarter of 2018 after being put on care-and-maintenance status in the fourth quarter of 2015. Yttrium was estimated to represent about 0.12% of the rare-earth elements in the Mountain Pass bastnaesite ore. Insufficient information was available to determine the yttrium content of mine production. Monazite, a rare-earth phosphate mineral, was produced as a separated concentrate that includes yttrium-rich xenotime. Both are accessory minerals in heavy-mineral-sand concentrates. There is no commercial separation facility in the United States, and rare-earth concentrates were exported for processing. The leading end uses of yttrium were in catalysts, ceramics, electronics, lasers, metallurgy, and phosphors. In ceramic applications, yttrium compounds were used in abrasives, bearings and seals, high-temperature refractories for continuous-casting nozzles, jet-engine coatings, oxygen sensors in automobile engines, and wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant cutting tools. In electronics, yttrium-iron garnets were components in microwave radar to control high-frequency signals. Yttrium was an important component in yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser crystals used in dental and medical surgical procedures, digital communications, distance and temperature sensing, industrial cutting and welding, nonlinear optics, photochemistry, and photoluminescence. In metallurgical applications, yttrium was used as a grain-refining additive and as a deoxidizer. Yttrium was used in heating-element alloys, high-temperature superconductors, and superalloys. Yttrium was used in phosphor compounds for flat-panel displays and various lighting applications.",Insignificant.,"China produced most of the worlds supply of yttrium from its weathered clay ion- adsorption ore deposits in the southern Provincesprimarily Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxiand from a lesser number of deposits in Guangxi and Hunan. Yttrium also was produced from similar clay deposits in Burma. Globally, yttrium was mainly consumed in the form of oxide compounds for ceramics and phosphors. Lesser amounts were consumed in electronic devices, lasers, optical glass, and metallurgical applications. The average prices for yttrium metal and Y2O3 each increased compared with those in 2021. Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology raised quotas for rare-earth mining and separation to 210,000 tons and 202,000 tons of rare-earth-oxide equivalent, respectively. The yttrium content of the production quota was not specified. Mine production was allocated to 190,850 tons of light rare earths and 19,150 tons of ion-adsorption clays. In 2022, Chinas exports of yttrium compounds and metal were estimated to be 2,400 tons of Y2O3 equivalent, and the leading export destinations were, in descending order, Japan, the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Germany. In 2021, Chinas exports of yttrium compounds were 2,100 tons of Y2O3 equivalent.","Large resources of yttrium in monazite and xenotime are available worldwide in placer deposits, carbonatites, uranium ores, and weathered clay deposits (ion-adsorption ore). Additional resources of yttrium occur in apatite-magnetite-bearing rocks, deposits of niobium-tantalum minerals, non-placer monazite-bearing deposits, sedimentary phosphate deposits, and uranium ores.","Substitutes for yttrium are available for some applications but generally are much less effective. In most uses, especially in electronics, lasers, and phosphors, yttrium is generally not subject to direct substitution by other elements. As a stabilizer in zirconia ceramics, Y2O3 may be substituted with calcium oxide or magnesium oxide, but the substitutes generally impart lower toughness."
