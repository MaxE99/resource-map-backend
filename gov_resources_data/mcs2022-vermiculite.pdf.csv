1000 MT,,2020.0,2021.0,2021.0,"'Two companies with mining and processing facilities in South Carolina and Virginia produced approximately 100,000 tons of vermiculite concentrate; data have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand tons to avoid disclosing company proprietary data. Flakes of raw vermiculite concentrate are micaceous in appearance and contain interlayer water in their structure. When the flakes are heated rapidly to a temperature above 870 degrees Celsius, the water flashes into steam, and the flakes expand into accordionlike particles. This process is called exfoliation or expansion, and the resulting ultralightweight material is chemically inert, fire resistant, and odorless. Most vermiculite concentrate produced in the United States was shipped to 15 exfoliating plants in nine States. The end uses for exfoliated vermiculite were estimated to be agriculture and horticulture, 32%; lightweight concrete aggregates (including cement premixes, concrete, and plaster), 24%; insulation, 9%; and other, 35%.'",'Insignificant.',"'U.S. exports and imports of vermiculite are not collected as a separate category by the U.S. Census Bureau. U.S. imports were estimated to be about 38,000 tons in 2021, a decrease which could be related to disruptions in the global supply chain. Most imports came from South Africa and Brazil in 2021. One U.S. company announced a packaging surcharge in 2021 owing to the rising costs it was incurring from its suppliers. In 2020, a U.S. exfoliating plant in Florida closed, while another in New Mexico ceased producing exfoliated vermiculite. Exploration and development of vermiculite deposits containing medium, large, and premium (coarser) grades (greater than 5-millimeter particle size) are likely to continue (mostly in China and South Africa) because of the higher demand for those grades. Finer grade production has exceeded consumption for several years, with Brazil and the United States continuing to be the leading producers. Producers will continue to investigate ways to increase the use of the finer grades in existing products and as a substitute for coarser vermiculite while continuing to develop new and innovative applications.'","'* In addition to the producing mines in South Carolina and Virginia, there are vermiculite occurrences in Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming that contain estimated resources of 2 million to 3 million tons. Significant deposits have been reported in Australia, China, Russia, Uganda, and some other countries, but reserve and resource information comes from many sources and, in most cases, it is not clear whether the numbers refer to vermiculite alone or vermiculite plus other minerals and host rock and overburden.'","'Expanded perlite is a substitute for exfoliated vermiculite in lightweight concrete and plaster. Other denser but less costly alternatives in these applications include expanded clay, shale, slag, and slate. Alternate materials for loose-fill fireproofing insulation include fiberglass, perlite, and slag wool. In agriculture, substitutes include bark and other plant materials, peat, perlite, sawdust, and synthetic soil conditioners.'"
