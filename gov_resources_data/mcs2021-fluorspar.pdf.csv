One company sold fluorspar from stockpiles produced as a byproduct of its limestone quarrying operation in Cave-in-Rock, IL, and continued development on its fluorspar mine in Kentucky. After acquiring a fluorspar mine in Utah, a second company continued a drilling program to further define the mineral resource and facilitate development of a mine plan. An estimated 29,000 tons of fluorosilicic acid (FSA), equivalent to about 47,000 tons of fluorspar grading 100%, was recovered from five phosphoric acid plants processing phosphate rock, which was primarily used in water fluoridation. The U.S. Department of Energy continued to produce aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) as a byproduct of the conversion of depleted uranium hexafluoride to depleted uranium oxide at plants in Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH. U.S. fluorspar consumption was satisfied primarily by imports. Domestically, production of HF in Louisiana and Texas was by far the leading use for acid-grade fluorspar. Hydrofluoric acid is the primary feedstock for the manufacture of virtually all fluorine-bearing chemicals, particularly refrigerants and fluoropolymers, and is also a key ingredient in the processing of aluminum and uranium. Fluorspar was also used in cement production, in enamels, as a flux in steelmaking, in glass manufacture, in iron and steel casting, and in welding rod coatings.'","'Synthetic fluorspar may be produced from neutralization of waste in the enrichment of uranium, petroleum alkylation, and stainless-steel pickling; however, undesirable impurities constrain use. Primary aluminum producers recycle HF and fluorides from smelting operations.'","'The global availability of fluorspar was estimated to have increased in 2020 owing to decreased consumption in some downstream applications and continued rampup of new mines in Canada and South Africa. On the consumption side, an increasing number of new projects continued to focus on developing alternatives to fluorspar in the manufacture of HF. Hydrofluoric acid was produced from FSA at four plants in China and a fifth plant was ramping up production in 2020. In June, a leading domestic fluorochemical producer and leading phosphoric acid producer announced a partnership to construct a 40,000-ton-per-year anhydrous HF plant in Aurora, NC, using FSA feedstock. The new plant, expected to begin production in 2022, would be the first plant of its kind outside of China, although similar projects were reportedly being evaluated in other countries. The agreement established a long-term HF supply agreement which would support production of fluorogases and fluoropolymers in Calvert City, KY. The capacity of existing U.S. HF plants that use fluorspar as a feedstock was 220,000 tons per year.'","'Large quantities of fluorine are present in phosphate rock. Current U.S. reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 1 billion tons, containing about 72 million tons of 100% fluorspar equivalent assuming an average fluorine content of 3.5% in the phosphate rock. World reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 71 billion tons, equivalent to about 5 billion tons of 100% fluorspar equivalent.'","'FSA is used to produce aluminum fluoride (AIFs) and HF. Because of differing physical properties, AIF 3 produced from FSA is not readily substituted for AIFs produced from fluorspar. Aluminum smelting dross, borax, calcium chloride, iron oxides, manganese ore, silica sand, and titanium dioxide have been used as substitutes for fluorspar fluxes.'"
