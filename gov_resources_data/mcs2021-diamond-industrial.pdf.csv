Mct,,2019,2020,2020.0,"'In 2020, total domestic primary production of manufactured industrial diamond bort, grit, and dust and powder was estimated to be 110 million carats with a value of $44 million, a slight decrease from that in 2019. No diamond stone was produced domestically. One firm with facilities in Florida and Ohio and a second firm in Pennsylvania accounted for all of the production. At least four firms produced polycrystalline diamond from diamond powder. At least two companies recovered used industrial diamond material from used diamond drill bits, diamond tools, and other diamond-containing wastes for recycling. The major consuming sectors of industrial diamond are computer chip production; construction; drilling for minerals, natural gas, and oil; machinery manufacturing; stone cutting and polishing; and transportation (infrastructure and vehicles). Highway building, milling, and repair and stone cutting consumed most of the industrial diamond stone. About 99% of U.S. industrial diamond apparent consumption was synthetic industrial diamond because its quality can be controlled and its properties can be customized.'","'In 2020, the amount of diamond bort, grit, and dust and powder recycled was estimated to be 35 million carats with an estimated value of $5.5 million. It was estimated that 98,000 carats of diamond stone was recycled with an estimated value of $150,000.'","'Most natural industrial diamond is produced as a byproduct of mining gem-quality diamond. Global natural industrial diamond production decreased slightly during 2020. This decrease was due to mine closures and lower output as mines approach the ends of their mine life. The worlds largest diamond mines have matured and are past their peak production levels, and several of the largest diamond mines are expected to close by the end of 2025. As these mines are depleted, global production is expected to continue to decline in quantity, and the global supply of crude natural diamond (including gem-quality and industrial diamond) is forecasted to steadily decrease to about 120 million carats in 2030. Worldwide diamond exploration spending has increased over the past few years. The success rate in diamond exploration has been estimated to be less than 1%, and no major deposit has been discovered in more than 20 years. In 2020, U.S. synthetic-industrial-diamond producers did not manufacture any diamond stone, and industrial diamond stone apparent consumption decreased. Domestic and global demand for synthetic diamond grit and powder is expected to remain greater than that for natural diamond material. In 2020, China was the leading producing country of synthetic industrial diamond, followed by the United States, Russia, Ireland, and South Africa, in descending order of quantity. These five countries produced about 99% of the worlds synthetic industrial diamond. Synthetic diamond accounted for more than 99% of global industrial diamond production and consumption. Worldwide production of manufactured industrial diamond totaled more than 14.6 billion carats. The United States is likely to continue to be one of the worlds leading markets for industrial diamond into the next decade and is expected to remain a significant producer and exporter of synthetic industrial diamond as well. U.S. demand for industrial diamond is likely to be strong in the construction sector as the United States continues building, milling, and repairing the Nations highway system. Industrial diamond coats the cutting edge of saws used to cut concrete in highway construction and repair work.'",['Natural diamond deposits have been discovered in more than 35 countries. Natural diamond accounts for about 1% of all industrial diamond used; synthetic diamond accounts for the remainder. At least 15 countries have the technology to produce synthetic diamond.,"'Materials that can compete with industrial diamond in some applications include manufactured abrasives, such as cubic boron nitride, fused aluminum oxide, and silicon carbide. Globally, synthetic diamond, rather than natural diamond, is used for about 99% of industrial applications.'"
