MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'Bromine was recovered from underground brines by two companies in Arkansas. Bromine is one of the leading mineral commodities, in terms of value, produced in Arkansas. The two bromine companies in the United States account for a large percentage of world production capacity. The leading global applications of bromine are for the production of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and clear brine drilling fluids. Bromine compounds are also used in a variety of other applications, including industrial uses, as intermediates, and for water treatment. U.S. apparent consumption of bromine in 2022 was estimated to be greater than that in 2021. '","'Some bromide solutions were recycled to obtain elemental bromine and to prevent the solutions from being disposed of as hazardous waste. For example, hydrogen bromide is emitted as a byproduct of many organic reactions; this byproduct can be recycled with virgin bromine brines and used as a source of bromine production. Bromine contained in plastics, such as BFRs, can be difficult and costly to remove; therefore, bromine-containing polymers will often be recycled with the virgin polymer and used again in new products. Bromine used in zinc-bromine batteries can be removed and completely recovered as bromine at the batterys end of life, purified, and used for new batteries. Available information was insufficient to estimate the quantity of bromine recovered and recycled.'","'The United States maintained its position as one of the leading bromine producers in the world along with China, Israel, and Jordan. In 2022, the leading source of imports of bromine and bromide compounds (gross weight) was Israel. The average import value of bromine and bromine compounds was estimated to have increased by over 20% in 2022 compared with that in 2021. Together, the leading imported bromine products in terms of both gross weight and bromine content were bromides and bromide oxides of ammonium, calcium, or zinc and bromides of sodium or potassium (over 90%). Estimated total imports of bromine and bromine compounds (bromine content) decreased slightly, whereas estimated total exports decreased by over 30% compared with those in 2021. In 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a final rule to reduce the exposure to decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), a BFR considered to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. The rule prohibited the manufacture, processing, distribution, or importing of decaBDE or products containing decaBDE. The importing, manufacturing, and processing of decaBDE and products to which decaBDE had been added was prohibited effective March 2021, and distribution prohibitions started in January 2022. Longer compliance dates or exclusions were set for certain uses such as aerospace vehicle parts, hospitality curtains, and wire and cable insulation used in nuclear power facilities. Because of health concerns, some States have established their own policies restricting the use of BFRs. Globally, bromine selling prices were higher in 2022 compared with those in 2021. Domestic sale volumes of bromine and bromine compounds also increased in 2022 compared with those in 2021 owing primarily to sales of BFRs. BFR sales were driven by strong demand for appliance, automotive, construction, and electronic industries. Sales of clear brine drilling fluids, the second leading use of bromine, also increased compared with those of the previous year. '","'Bromine is found principally in seawater, evaporitic (salt) lakes, and underground brines associated with petroleum deposits. The Dead Sea, in the Middle East, is estimated to contain 1 billion tons of bromine. Seawater contains about 65 parts per million bromine, or an estimated 100 trillion tons. Bromine is also recovered from seawater as a coproduct during evaporation to produce salt.'","'Chlorine and iodine may be substituted for bromine in a few chemical reactions and for sanitation purposes. There are no comparable substitutes for bromine in various oil- and gas-well-completion and packer applications. Because plastics have a low ignition temperature, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, organic chlorine compounds, and phosphorus compounds can be substituted for bromine as fire retardants in some uses.'"
