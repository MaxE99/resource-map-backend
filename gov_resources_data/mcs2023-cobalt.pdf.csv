MT,,2021,2022,2022,"'In 2022, the nickel-copper Eagle Mine in Michigan produced cobalt-bearing nickel concentrate. In Missouri, a company produced nickel-copper-cobalt concentrate from historic mine tailings and was building a hydrometallurgical processing plant near the mine site. In October, commissioning began at a cobalt- copper-gold mine and mill in Idaho, where cobalt concentrate will be produced. This mine and one in Morocco are the only mines in the world where cobalt is the principal product. Most U.S. cobalt supply consisted of imports and secondary (scrap) materials. About six companies in the United States produced cobalt chemicals. An estimated 40% of the cobalt consumed in the United States was used in superalloys, mainly in aircraft gas turbine engines; 35% in a variety of chemical applications; 15% in various other metallic applications; and 10% in cemented carbides for cutting and wear-resistant applications. The total estimated value of cobalt consumed in 2022 was $530 million.'","'In 2022, cobalt contained in purchased scrap represented an estimated 24% of estimated cobalt consumption.'","'Global cobalt mine and refinery production were forecast to increase to record-high levels in 2022. The increase in mine production was mainly in Congo (Kinshasa) and in Indonesia, where new mining and processing projects were starting production. Congo (Kinshasa) continued to be the worlds leading source of mined cobalt, accounting for about 70% of world cobalt mine production. With the exception of some production in the United States, production in Morocco, and artisanally mined cobalt in Congo (Kinshasa), most cobalt is mined as a byproduct of copper or nickel. China was the worlds leading producer of refined cobalt, most of which was produced from partially refined cobalt imported from Congo (Kinshasa). China was the worlds leading consumer of cobalt, with about 80% of its consumption used by the rechargeable battery industry.'","'Identified cobalt resources of the United States are estimated to be about 1 million tons. Most of these resources are in Minnesota, but other important occurrences are in Alaska, California, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. With the exception of resources in Idaho and Missouri, any future cobalt production from these deposits would be as a byproduct of another metal. Identified world terrestrial cobalt resources are about 25 million tons. The vast majority of these resources are in sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits in Congo (Kinshasa) and Zambia; nickel-bearing laterite deposits in Australia and nearby island countries and Cuba; and magmatic nickel-copper sulfide deposits hosted in mafic and ultramafic rocks in Australia, Canada, Russia, and the United States. More than 120 million tons of cobalt resources have been identified in polymetallic nodules and crusts on the floor of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.'","'Depending on the application, substitution for cobalt could result in a loss in product performance or an increase in cost. The cobalt contents of lithium-ion batteries, the leading global use for cobalt, are being reduced; potential commercially available cobalt-free substitutes use iron and phosphorus. Potential substitutes in other applications include barium or strontium ferrites, neodymium-iron-boron alloys, or nickel-iron alloys in magnets; cerium, iron, lead, manganese, or vanadium in paints; cobalt-iron-copper or iron-copper in diamond tools; copper- iron-manganese for curing unsaturated polyester resins; iron, iron-cobalt-nickel, nickel, ceramic-metallic composites (cermets), or ceramics in cutting and wear-resistant materials; nickel-base alloys or ceramics in jet engines; nickel in petroleum catalysts; rhodium in hydroformylation catalysts; and titanium-base alloys in prosthetics.'"
