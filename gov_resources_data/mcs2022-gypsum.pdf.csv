1000 MT,,2020,2021,2021,"'In 2021, domestic production of crude gypsum was estimated to be 23 million tons with a value of about $210 million. The leading crude gypsum-producing States were estimated to be California, lowa, Kansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. Overall, 47 companies produced or processed gypsum in the'","'Approximately 700,000 tons of gypsum scrap that was generated by wallboard manufacturing was recycled onsite. The recycling of wallboard from new construction and demolition sources also took place, although those amounts are unknown. Recycled gypsum was used primarily for agricultural purposes and feedstock for the manufacture of new wallboard. Other potential markets for recycled gypsum include athletic-field marking, cement production (as a stucco additive), grease absorption, sludge drying, and water treatment.'","'U.S. crude gypsum production increased by an estimated 8%, and apparent consumption increased by 7% compared with that in 2020. U.S. gypsum imports increased by an estimated 14% compared with those in 2020. Exports, although very low compared with imports and often subject to wide fluctuations, increased by an estimated 9%. Demand for gypsum depends principally on construction industry activity, particularly in the United States, where the majority of gypsum consumed is used for agriculture, building plasters, the manufacture of portland cement, and wallboard products. Despite disruptions caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the production of gypsum was not affected. The United States, the worlds leading crude gypsum producer, produced an estimated 23 million tons. Iran was the second-leading producer with an estimated 16 million tons of crude production, followed by China with 13 million tons. Increased use of wallboard in Asia, coupled with new gypsum product plants, spurred increased production in the region. As wallboard becomes more widely used, worldwide gypsum production is expected to increase.'","'* Reserves are large in major producing countries, but data for most are not available. Domestic gypsum resources are adequate but unevenly distributed. Large imports from Canada augment domestic supplies for wallboard manufacturing in the United States, particularly in the eastern and southern coastal regions. Imports from Mexico supplement domestic supplies for wallboard manufacturing along portions of the United States western seaboard. Large gypsum deposits occur in the Great Lakes region, the midcontinent region, and several Western States. Foreign resources are large and widely distributed; 78 countries were thought to produce gypsum in 2021.'","'In such applications as stucco and plaster, cement and lime may be substituted for gypsum; brick, glass, metallic or plastic panels, and wood may be substituted for wallboard. Gypsum has no practical substitute in the manufacturing of portland cement. Synthetic gypsum generated by various industrial processes, including flue gas desulfurization of smokestack emissions, is very important as a substitute for mined gypsum in wallboard manufacturing, cement production, and agricultural applications (in descending order by tonnage). In 2021, synthetic gypsum was estimated to account for about 30% of the total domestic gypsum supply.'"
