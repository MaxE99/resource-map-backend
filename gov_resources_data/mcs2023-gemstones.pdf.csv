$ M.,,2021,2022,"'The combined value of U.S. natural and synthetic gemstone output in 2022 was an estimated $95 million, a 7% increase compared with that in 2021. Domestic gemstone production included agate, beryl, coral, diamond, garnet, jade, jasper, opal, pearl, quartz, sapphire, shell, topaz, tourmaline, turquoise, and many other gem materials. In descending order of production value, Arizona led the Nation in natural gemstone production, followed by Oregon and Nevada. These three States accounted for 47% of the natural gemstone production in the United States. Other top producing States, in descending order of production value, were California, Montana, Maine, Colorado, Arkansas, Utah, and Idaho. Synthetic gemstones were manufactured by eight companies in North Carolina, California, Oregon, Maryland, New York, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and Arizona, in descending order of production value. U.S. synthetic gemstone production increased by 7% compared with that in 2021. Major gemstone end uses were carvings, gem and mineral collections, and jewelry.'","'Gemstones are often recycled by being resold as estate jewelry, reset, or recut, but this report does not account for those stones.'","'In 2022, the U.S. gemstone and jewelry industries had recovered for the most part from the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related restrictions, lockdowns, and temporary mine and store closings. Total world diamond production during 2022 was estimated to have increased slightly from 2021 levels. The largest production increases in 2022 were from Angola, Botswana, and Namibia. The largest production decreases in 2022 were in Canada, Congo (Kinshasa), Lesotho, and Russia. Production would need to increase by about 2% per year during the next 5 years to allow the market to fully rebalance after the COVID-19 pandemic. Online auctions gained a higher share of rough diamond sales and offset deficits in traditional sales channels. Many jewelry stores successfully shifted sales to their websites; online diamond jewelry sales exceeded 25% of 2022 sales. Global gemstone sales are expected to increase at a steady rate over the next 5 years. In 2022, U.S. imports for consumption of gemstones were about $30 billion, which was a 22% increase compared with $24.6 billion in 2021. These imports consisted of about $26 billion in gem-quality diamonds, which was an 18% increase compared with $21.8 billion in 2021, and about $4.3 billion in nondiamond gemstones, which was a 49% increase compared with $2.88 billion in 2021. The increase in U.S. gemstone production combined with the increase in U.S. gemstone imports and the increase in gemstone exports produced a 19% increase in apparent consumption to a value of $28 billion. This apparent consumption consisted of $24 billion in gem-quality diamond and $4 billion in nondiamond gemstones. The United States was one of the leading global markets in terms of sales and is expected to continue to dominate global gemstone consumption. '","' Most diamond ore bodies have a diamond content that ranges from less than 1 carat to about 6 carats per ton of ore. The major diamond reserves are in southern Africa, Australia, Canada, and Russia.'","'Glass, plastics, and other materials are substituted for natural gemstones. Synthetic gemstones (manufactured materials that have the same chemical and physical properties as natural gemstones) are common substitutes. Simulants (materials that appear to be gems but differ in chemical and physical characteristics) also are frequently substituted for natural gemstones.'"
