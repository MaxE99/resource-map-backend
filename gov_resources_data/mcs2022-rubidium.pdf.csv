MT,"In 2021, no rubidium was mined in the United States; however, occurrences of rubidium-bearing minerals are known in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, South Dakota, and Utah. Rubidium is also associated with some evaporate mineral occurrences in other States. Rubidium is not a major constituent of any mineral. Rubidium concentrate is produced as a byproduct of pollucite (cesium) and lepidolite (lithium) mining and is imported from other countries for processing in the United States. Applications for rubidium and its compounds include biomedical research, electronics, specialty glass, and pyrotechnics. Specialty glasses are the leading market for rubidium; rubidium carbonate is used to reduce electrical conductivity, which improves stability and durability in fiber-optic telecommunications networks. Biomedical applications include rubidium salts used in antishock agents and the treatment of epilepsy and thyroid disorder; rubidium-82, a radioactive isotope used as a blood-flow tracer in positron emission tomographic imaging; and rubidium chloride, used as an antidepressant. Rubidium atoms are used in academic research, including the development of quantum-mechanics-based computing devices, a future application with potential for relatively high consumption of rubidium. Quantum computing research uses ultracold rubidium atoms in a variety of applications. Quantum computers, which have the ability to perform more complex computational tasks than traditional computers by calculating in two quantum states simultaneously, were expected to be in prototype phase within 10 years. Rubidiums photoemissive properties make it useful for electrical-signal generators in motion-sensor devices, night- vision devices, photoelectric cells (solar panels), and photomultiplier tubes. Rubidium is used as an atomic resonance-frequency-reference oscillator for telecommunications network synchronization, playing a vital role in global positioning systems. Rubidium-rich feldspars are used in ceramic applications for spark plugs and electrical insulators because of their high dielectric constant. Rubidium hydroxide is used in fireworks to oxidize mixtures of other elements and produce violet hues. The U.S. military frequency standard, the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) timescale, is based on 48 weighted atomic clocks, including 4 USNO rubidium fountain clocks.",None.,"Domestic rubidium occurrences will remain uneconomic unless market conditions change, such as the development of new end uses or increased consumption for existing end uses, which in turn could lead to increased prices. No known human health issues are associated with exposure to naturally occurring rubidium, and its use has minimal environmental impact. During 2021, no rubidium production was reported globally but rubidium was thought to have been produced in China. Production of rubidium from all countries, excluding China, ceased within the past two decades. Production in Namibia ceased in the early 2000s, followed by the Tanco Mine in Canada shutting down and later being sold after a mine collapse in 2015. The Bikita Mine in Zimbabwe was depleted of pollucite ore reserves in 2018, and the Sinclair Mine in Australia completed the mining and shipments of all economically recoverable pollucite ore in 2019. Recent reports indicate that with current processing rates, the worlds stockpiles of rubidium ore, excluding those in China, will be depleted by 2022. The primary processing plant of rubidium compounds globally, located in Germany, has reportedly operated far below capacity for the past few years. A company completed an updated mineral resource estimate for the Karibib project in Namibia, reporting 8.9 million metric tons of measured and indicated resources containing 0.23% rubidium and 303 parts per million cesium. The company also reported 6.72 million metric tons of proven and probable reserves containing 2.26% rubidium and 320 parts per million cesium. Located in the Karibib Pegmatite Belt, lithium would be the primary product, with cesium, potassium, and rubidium as potential byproducts.","Significant rubidium-bearing pegmatite occurrences have been identified in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Peru, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zambia. Minor quantities of rubidium are reported in brines in northern Chile and China and in evaporites in the United States (New Mexico and Utah), France, and Germany.","Rubidium and cesium can be used interchangeably in many applications because they have similar physical properties and atomic radii. Cesium, however, is more electropositive than rubidium, making it a preferred material for some applications."
